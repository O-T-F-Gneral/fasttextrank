separate accounts go mainstream investment new entrants are shaking up the separateaccount industry by supplying webbased platforms that give advisers the tools to pick independent money managers does classicism explain universality arguments against a pure classical component of mind one of the hallmarks of human cognition is the capacity to generalize over arbitrary constituents marcus cognition 66 p153 cognitive psychology 37 p 243 1998 argued that this capacity called universal generalization universality is not supported by connectionist models instead universality is best explained by classical symbol systems with connectionism as its implementation here it is argued that universality is also a problem for classicism in that the syntaxsensitive rules that are supposed to provide causal explanations of mental processes are either too strict precluding possible generalizations or too lax providing no information as to the appropriate alternative consequently universality is not explained by a classical theory a conflict between language and atomistic information fred dretske and jerry fodor are responsible for popularizing three wellknown theses in contemporary philosophy of mind the thesis of informationbased semantics ibs the thesis of content atomism atomism and the thesis of the language of thought lot lot concerns the semantically relevant structure of representations involved in cognitive states such as beliefs and desires it maintains that all such representations must have syntactic structures mirroring the structure of their contents ibs is a thesis about the nature of the relations that connect cognitive representations and their parts to their contents semantic relations it holds that these relations supervene solely on relations of the kind that support information content perhaps with some help from logical principles of combination atomism is a thesis about the nature of the content of simple symbols it holds that each substantive simple symbol possesses its content independently of all other symbols in the representational system i argue that dretskes and fodors theories are false and that their falsehood results from a conflict ibs and atomism on the one hand and lot on the other selective representing and worldmaking we discuss the thesis of selective representingthe idea that the contents of the mental representations had by organisms are highly constrained by the biological niches within which the organisms evolved while such a thesis has been defended by several authors elsewhere our primary concern here is to take up the issue of the compatibility of selective representing and realism we hope to show three things first that the notion of selective representing is fully consistent with the realist idea of a mindindependent world second that not only are these two consistent but that the latter the realist conception of a mindindependent world provides the most powerful perspective from which to motivate and understand the differing perceptual and cognitive profiles themselves third that the genuine and important sense in which organism and environment may together constitute an integrated system of scientific interest poses no additional threat to the realist conception lobs theorem as a limitation on mechanism we argue that lobs theorem implies a limitation on mechanism specifically we argue via an application of a generalized version of lobs theorem that any particular device known by an observer to be mechanical cannot be used as an epistemic authority of a particular type by that observer either the beliefset of such an authority is not mechanizable or if it is there is no identifiable formal system of which the observer can know or truly believe it to be the theoremset this gives we believe an important and hitherto unnoticed connection between mechanism and the use of authorities by humanlike epistemic agents games machines play individual rationality or doing what is best for oneself is a standard model used to explain and predict human behavior and von neumannmorgenstern game theory is the classical mathematical formalization of this theory in multipleagent settings individual rationality however is an inadequate model for the synthesis of artificial social systems where cooperation is essential since it does not permit the accommodation of group interests other than as aggregations of individual interests satisficing game theory is based upon a welldefined notion of being good enough and does accommodate group as well as individual interests through the use of conditional preference relationships whereby a decision maker is able to adjust its preferences as a function of the preferences and not just the options of others this new theory is offered as an alternative paradigm to construct artificial societies that are capable of complex behavior that goes beyond exclusive self interest the averagecase identifiability and controllability of large scale systems needs for increased product quality reduced pollution and reduced energy and material consumption are driving enhanced process integration this increases the number of manipulated and measured variables required by the control system to achieve its objectives this paper addresses the question of whether processes tend to become increasingly more difficult to identify and control as the process dimension increases tools and results of multivariable statistics are used to show that under a variety of assumed distributions on the elements square processes of higher dimension tend to be more difficult to identify and control whereas the expected controllability and identifiability of nonsquare processes depends on the relative numbers of measured and manipulated variables these results suggest that the procedure of simplifying the control problem so that only a square process is considered is a poor practice for large scale systems robust modelorder reduction of complex biological processes this paper addresses robust modelorder reduction of a high dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation pde model of a complex biological process based on a nonlinear distributed parameter model of the same process which was validated against experimental data of an existing pilotscale biological nutrient removal bnr activated sludge plant we developed a statespace model with 154 state variables a general algorithm for robustly reducing the nonlinear pde model is presented and based on an investigation of five stateoftheart modelorder reduction techniques we are able to reduce the original model to a model with only 30 states without incurring pronounced modelling errors the singular perturbation approximation balanced truncating technique is found to give the lowest modelling errors in low frequency ranges and hence is deemed most suitable for controller design and other realtime applications conditions for decentralized integral controllability the term decentralized integral controllability dic pertains to the existence of stable decentralized controllers with integral action that have closedloop properties such as stable independent detuning it is especially useful to select control structures systematically at the early stage of control system design because the only information needed for dic is the steadystate process gain matrix here a necessary and sufficient condition conjectured in the literature is proved the real structured singular value which can exploit realness of the controller gain is used to describe computable conditions for dic the primary usage of dic is to eliminate unworkable pairings for this two other simple necessary conditions are proposed examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions for dic quadratic programming algorithms for largescale model predictive control quadratic programming qp methods are an important element in the application of model predictive control mpc as larger and more challenging mpc applications are considered more attention needs to be focused on the construction and tailoring of efficient qp algorithms in this study we tailor and apply a new qp method called qpschur to large mpc applications such as cross directional control problems in paper machines written in c qpschur is an object oriented implementation of a novel dual space schur complement algorithm we compare this approach to three widely applied qp algorithms and show that qpschur is significantly more efficient up to two orders of magnitude than the other algorithms in addition detailed simulations are considered that demonstrate the importance of the flexible object oriented construction of qpschur along with additional features for constraint handling warm starts and partial solution robust output feedback model predictive control using offline linear matrix inequalities a fundamental question about model predictive control mpc is its robustness to model uncertainty in this paper we present a robust constrained output feedback mpc algorithm that can stabilize plants with both polytopic uncertainty and normbound uncertainty the design procedure involves offline design of a robust constrained state feedback mpc law and a state estimator using linear matrix inequalities lmis since we employ an offline approach for the controller design which gives a sequence of explicit control laws we are able to analyze the robust stabilizability of the combined control laws and estimator and by adjusting the design parameters guarantee robust stability of the closedloop system in the presence of constraints the algorithm is illustrated with two examples robust selftuning pid controller for nonlinear systems in this paper we propose a robust selftuning pid controller suitable for nonlinear systems the control system employs a preload relay prelay in series with a pid controller the prelay ensures a high gain to yield a robust performance however it also incurs a chattering phenomenon in this paper instead of viewing the chattering as an undesirable yet inevitable feature we use it as a naturally occurring signal for tuning and retuning the pid controller as the operating regime digresses no other explicit input signal is required once the pid controller is tuned for a particular operating point the relay may be disabled and chattering ceases correspondingly however it is invoked when there is a change in setpoint to another operating regime in this way the approach is also applicable to timevarying systems as the pid tuning can be continuous based on the latest set of chattering characteristics analysis is provided on the stability properties of the control scheme simulation results for the level control of fluid in a spherical tank using the scheme are also presented a selforganizing contextbased approach to the tracking of multiple robot trajectories we have combined competitive and hebbian learning in a neural network designed to learn and recall complex spatiotemporal sequences in such sequences a particular item may occur more than once or the sequence may share states with another sequence processing of repeatedshared states is a hard problem that occurs very often in the domain of robotics the proposed model consists of two groups of synaptic weights competitive interlayer and hebbian intralayer connections which are responsible for encoding respectively the spatial and temporal features of the input sequence three additional mechanisms allow the network to deal with shared states context units neurons disabled from learning and redundancy used to encode sequence states the network operates by determining the current and the next state of the learned sequences the model is simulated over various sets of robot trajectories in order to evaluate its storage and retrieval abilities its sequence sampling effects its robustness to noise and its tolerance to fault evolving receptivefield controllers for mobile robots the use of evolutionary methods to generate controllers for realworld autonomous agents has attracted attention most of the pertinent research has employed genetic algorithms or variations thereof research has applied an alternative evolutionary method evolution strategies to the generation of simple braitenberg vehicles this application accelerates the development of such controllers by more than an order of magnitude a few hours compared to more than two days motivated by this useful speedup the paper investigates the evolution of more complex architectures receptivefield controllers that can employ nonlinear interactions and therefore can yield more complex behavior it is interesting to note that the evolution strategy yields the same efficacy in terms of function evaluations even though the second class of controllers requires up to 10 times more parameters than the simple braitenberg architecture in addition to the speedup there is an important theoretical reason for preferring an evolution strategy over a genetic algorithm for this problem namely the presence of epistasis a scalable intelligent takeoff controller for a simulated running jointed leg running with jointed legs poses a difficult control problem in robotics neural controllers are attractive because they allow the robot to adapt to changing environmental conditions however scalability is an issue with many neural controllers the paper describes the development of a scalable neurofuzzy controller for the takeoff phase of the running stride scalability is achieved by selecting a controller whose size does not grow with the dimensionality of the problem empirical results show that with proper design the takeoff controller scales from a leg with a single movable link to one with three movable links without a corresponding growth in size and without a loss of accuracy modelling of complete robot dynamics based on a multidimensional rbflike neural architecture a neural network based identification approach of manipulator dynamics is presented for a structured modelling rbflike static neural networks are used in order to represent and adapt all model parameters with their nonlinear dependences on the joint positions the neural architecture is hierarchically organised to reach optimal adjustment to structural a prioriknowledge about the identification problem the model structure is substantially simplified by general system analysis independent of robot type but also a lot of specific features of the utilised experimental robot are taken into account a fixed grid based neuron placement together with application of bspline polynomial basis functions is utilised favourably for a very effective recursive implementation of the neural architecture thus an online identification of a dynamic model is submitted for a complete 6 joint industrial robot scalable techniques from nonparametric statistics for real time robot learning locally weighted learning lwl is a class of techniques from nonparametric statistics that provides useful representations and training algorithms for learning about complex phenomena during autonomous adaptive control of robotic systems the paper introduces several lwl algorithms that have been tested successfully in realtime learning of complex robot tasks we discuss two major classes of lwl memorybased lwl and purely incremental lwl that does not need to remember any data explicitly in contrast to the traditional belief that lwl methods cannot work well in highdimensional spaces we provide new algorithms that have been tested on up to 90 dimensional learning problems the applicability of our lwl algorithms is demonstrated in various robot learning examples including the learning of devilsticking polebalancing by a humanoid robot arm and inversedynamics learning for a seven and a 30 degreeoffreedom robot in all these examples the application of our statistical neural networks techniques allowed either faster or more accurate acquisition of motor control than classical control engineering a scalable model of cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing the recurrent slide and latch rsl model from the dawn of modern neural network theory the mammalian cerebellum has been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies early studies focused on the fanout convergence thresholding and learned weighting of perceptualmotor signals within the cerebellar cortex this led to the still viable idea that the granule cell stage in the cerebellar cortex performs a sparse expansive recoding of the timevarying input vector this recoding reveals and emphasizes combinations in a distributed representation that serves as a basis for the learned statedependent control actions engendered by cerebellar outputs to movement related centers to make optimal use of available signals the cerebellum must be able to sift the evolving state representation for the most reliable predictors of the need for control actions and to use those predictors even if they appear only transiently and well in advance of the optimal time for initiating the control action the paper proposes a modification to prior population models for cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing since it replaces a population with a single element the proposed rsl model is in one sense maximally efficient and therefore optimal from the perspective of scalability searching a scalable approach to cerebellar based control decades of research into the structure and function of the cerebellum have led to a clear understanding of many of its cells as well as how learning might take place furthermore there are many theories on what signals the cerebellum operates on and how it works in concert with other parts of the nervous system nevertheless the application of computational cerebellar models to the control of robot dynamics remains in its infant state to date few applications have been realized the currently emerging family of lightweight robots poses a new challenge to robot control due to their complex dynamics traditional methods depending on a full analysis of the dynamics of the system are no longer applicable since the joints influence each other dynamics during movement can artificial cerebellar models compete here fabrication of polymeric microlens of hemispherical shape using micromolding polymeric microlenses play an important role in reducing the size weight and cost of optical data storage and optical communication systems we fabricate polymeric microlenses using the microcompression molding process the design and fabrication procedures for mold insertion is simplified using silicon instead of metal pmma powder is used as the molding material governed by process parameters such as temperature and pressure histories the micromolding process is controlled to minimize various defects that develop during the molding process the radius of curvature and magnification ratio of fabricated microlens are measured as 150 mu m and over 30 respectively optical setup and analysis of disktype photopolymer highdensity holographic storage a relatively simple scheme for disktype photopolymer highdensity holographic storage based on angular and spatial multiplexing is described the effects of the optical setup on the recording capacity and density are studied calculations and analysis show that this scheme is more effective than a scheme based on the spatioangular multiplexing for disktype photopolymer highdensity holographic storage which has a limited medium thickness also an optimal beam recording angle exists to achieve maximum recording capacity and density harmless delays in cohengrossberg neural networks without assuming monotonicity and differentiability of the activation functions and any symmetry of interconnections we establish some sufficient conditions for the globally asymptotic stability of a unique equilibrium for the cohengrossberg 1983 neural network with multiple delays lyapunov functionals and functions combined with the razumikhin technique are employed the criteria are all independent of the magnitudes of the delays and thus the delays under these conditions are harmless supersampling multiframe blind deconvolution resolution enhancement of adaptive optics compensated imagery of low earth orbit satellites we describe a postprocessing methodology for reconstructing undersampled image sequences with randomly varying blur that can provide image enhancement beyond the sampling resolution of the sensor this method is demonstrated on simulated imagery and on adaptiveopticsaocompensated imagery taken by the starfire optical range 35m telescope that has been artificially undersampled also shown are the results of multiframe blind deconvolution of some of the highest quality optical imagery of low earth orbit satellites collected with a groundbased telescope to date the algorithm used is a generalization of multiframe blind deconvolution techniques that include a representation of spatial sampling by the focal plane array elements based on a forward stochastic model this generalization enables the random shifts and shape of the aocompensated point spread function psf to be used to partially eliminate the aliasing effects associated with subnyquist sampling of the image by the focal plane array the method could be used to reduce resolution loss that occurs when imaging in widefieldofview fov modes errorprobability analysis of milstd1773 optical fiber data buses we have analyzed the error probabilities of milstd1773 optical fiber data buses with three modulation schemes namely original manchester ii biphase coding ptmbc and embcbsf using these derived expressions of error probabilities we can also compare the receiver sensitivities of such optical fiber data buses bad pixel identification by means of principal components analysis bad pixels are defined as those pixels showing a temporal evolution of the signal different from the rest of the pixels of a given array principal component analysis helps us to understand the definition of a statistical distance associated with each pixels and using this distance it is possible to identify those pixels labeled as bad pixels the spatiality of a pixel is also calculated an assumption about the normality of the distribution of the distances of the pixels is revised although the influence on the robustness of the identification algorithm is negligible the definition of a parameter related with this nonnormality helps to identify those principal components and eigenimages responsible for the departure from a multinormal distribution the method for identifying the bad pixels is successfully applied to a set of frames obtained from a ccd visible and a focal plane array fpa ir camera simple nonlinear dualwindow operator for edge detection we propose a nonlinear edge detection technique based on a twoconcentriccircularwindow operator we perform a preliminary selection of edge candidates using a standard gradient and use the dualwindow operator to reveal edges as zerocrossing points of a simple difference function depending only on the minimum and maximum values in the two windows comparisons with other wellestablished techniques are reported in terms of visual appearance and computational efficiency they show that detected edges are surely comparable with cannys and laplacian of gaussian algorithms with a noteworthy reduction in terms of computational load rational systems exhibit moderate risk aversion with respect to gambles on variableresolution compression in an embedded wavelet scheme for progressive transmission a tree structure naturally defines the spatial relationship on the hierarchical pyramid transform coefficients over each tree correspond to a unique local spatial region of the original image and they can be coded bitplane by bitplane through successiveapproximation quantization after receiving the approximate value of some coefficients the decoder can obtain a reconstructed image we show a rational system for progressive transmission that in absence of a priori knowledge about regions of interest chooses at any truncation time among alternative trees for further transmission in such a way as to avoid certain forms of behavioral inconsistency we prove that some rational transmission systems might exhibit aversion to risk involving gambles on treedependent quality of encoding while others favor taking such risks based on an acceptable predictor for visual distinctness from digital imagery we demonstrate that without any outside knowledge riskprone systems as well as those with strong risk aversion appear in capable of attaining the quality of reconstructions that can be achieved with moderate riskaverse behavior watermarking techniques for electronic delivery of remote sensing images earth observation missions have recently attracted a growing interest mainly due to the large number of possible applications capable of exploiting remotely sensed data and images along with the increase of market potential the need arises for the protection of the image products such a need is a very crucial one because the internet and other publicprivate networks have become preferred means of data exchange a critical issue arising when dealing with digital image distribution is copyright protection such a problem has been largely addressed by resorting to watermarking technology a question that obviously arises is whether the requirements imposed by remote sensing imagery are compatible with existing watermarking techniques on the basis of these motivations the contribution of this work is twofold assessment of the requirements imposed by remote sensing applications on watermarkbased copyright protection and modification of two wellestablished digital watermarking techniques to meet such constraints more specifically the concept of nearlossless watermarking is introduced and two possible algorithms matching such a requirement are presented experimental results are shown to measure the impact of watermark introduction on a typical remote sensing application ie unsupervised image classification use of spot images as a tool for coastal zone management and monitoring of environmental impacts in the coastal zone modern techniques such as remote sensing have been one of the main factors leading toward the achievement of serious plans regarding coastal management a multitemporal analysis of land use in certain areas of the colombian caribbean coast is described it mainly focuses on environmental impacts caused by anthropogenic activities such as deforestation of mangroves due to shrimp farming selection of sensitive areas percentage of destroyed mangroves possible endangered areas etc are some of the results of this analysis recommendations for a coastal management plan in the area have also resulted from this analysis some other consequences of the deforestation of mangroves in the coastal zone and the construction of shrimp ponds are also analyzed such as the increase of erosion problems in these areas and water pollution among others the increase of erosion in these areas has also changed part of their morphology which has been studied by the analysis of spot images in previous years a serious concern exists about the future of these areas for this reason new techniques like satellite images spot have been applied with good results leading to more effective control and coastal management in the area the use of spot images to study changes of the land use of the area is a useful technique to determine patterns of human activities and suggest solutions for severe problems in these areas extracting straight road structure in urban environments using ikonos satellite imagery we discuss a fully automatic technique for extracting roads in urban environments the method has its bases in a vegetation mask derived from multispectral ikonos data and in texture derived from panchromatic ikonos data these two techniques together are used to distinguish road pixels we then move from individual pixels to an objectbased representation that allows reasoning on a higher level recognition of individual segments and intersections and the relationships among them are used to determine underlying road structure and to then logically hypothesize the existence of additional road network components we show results on an image of san diego california the objectbased processing component may be adapted to utilize other basis techniques as well and could be used to build a road network in any scene having a straightline structured topology novel approach to superresolution pits readout we proposed a novel method to realize the readout of superresolution pits by using a superresolution reflective film to replace the reflective layer of the conventional rom at the same time by using sb as the superresolution reflective layer and sin as a dielectric layer the superresolution pits with diameters of 380 nm were read out by a setup whose laser wavelength is 6328 nm and numerical aperture is 040 in addition the influence of the sb thin film thickness on the readout signal was investigated the results showed that the optimum sb thin film thickness is 28 to 30 nm and the maximum cnr is 38 to 40 db effect of insulation layer on transcribability and birefringence distribution in optical disk substrate as the need for information storage media with high storage density increases digital video disks dvds with smaller recording marks and thinner optical disk substrates than those of conventional dvds are being required therefore improving the replication quality of landgroove or pit structure and reducing the birefringence distribution are emerging as important criteria in the fabrication of highdensity optical disk substrates we control the transcribability and distribution of birefringence by inserting an insulation layer under the stamper during injectioncompression molding of dvd ram substrates the effects of the insulation layer on the geometrical and optical properties such as transcribability and birefringence distribution are examined experimentally the inserted insulation layer is found to be very effective in improving the quality of replication and leveling out the first peak of the gapwise birefringence distribution near the mold wall and reducing the average birefringence value because the insulation layer retarded the growth of the solidified layer comparison of automated digital elevation model extraction results using alongtrack aster and acrosstrack spot stereo images a digital elevation model dem can be extracted automatically from stereo satellite images during the past decade the most common satellite data used to extract dem was the acrosstrack spot recently the addition of alongtrack aster data which can be downloaded freely provides another attractive alternative to extract dem data this work compares the automated dem extraction results using an aster stereo pair and a spot stereo pair over an area of hilly mountains in drum mountain utah when compared to a usgs 75min dem standard product the result shows that spot produces better dem results in terms of accuracy and details if the radiometric variations between the images taken on subsequent satellite revolutions are small otherwise the aster stereo pair is a better choice because of simultaneous alongtrack acquisition during a single pass compared to the usgs 75min dem the aster and the spot extracted dems have a standard deviation of 116 and 46 m respectively noiseconstrained hyperspectral data compression storage and transmission requirements for hyperspectral data sets are significant to reduce hardware costs welldesigned compression techniques are needed to preserve information content while maximizing compression ratios lossless compression techniques maintain data integrity but yield small compression ratios we present a slightly lossy compression algorithm that uses the noise statistics of the data to preserve information content while maximizing compression ratios the adaptive principal components analysis apca algorithm uses noise statistics to determine the number of significant principal components and selects only those that are required to represent each pixel to within the noise level we demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods with airborne visibleinfrared spectrometer aviris hyperspectral digital imagery collection experiment hydice hyperspectral mapper hymap and hyperion datasets satellite image collection optimization imaging satellite systems represent a high capital cost optimizing the collection of images is critical for both satisfying customer orders and building a sustainable satellite operations business we describe the functions of an operational multivariable time dynamic optimization system that maximizes the daily collection of satellite images a graphical user interface allows the operator to quickly see the results of what if adjustments to an image collection plan used for both long range planning and daily collection scheduling of space imagings ikonos satellite the satellite control and tasking sct software allows collection commands to be altered up to 10 min before upload to the satellite optical twostep modified signeddigit addition based on binary logic gates a new modified signeddigit msd addition algorithm based on binary logic gates is proposed for parallel computing it is shown that by encoding each of the input msd digits and flag digits into a pair of binary bits the number of addition steps can be reduced to two the flag digit is introduced to characterize the next low order pair nlop of the input digits in order to suppress carry propagation the rules for twostep addition of binary coded msd bcmsd numbers are formulated that can be implemented using optical shadowcasting logic system vibration control of the rotating flexibleshaftmultiflexibledisk system with the eddycurrent damper in this paper the rotating flexibletimoshenkoshaftflexibledisk coupling system is formulated by applying the assumedmode method into the kinetic and strain energies and the virtual work done by the eddycurrent damper from lagranges equations the resulting discretized equations of motion can be simplified as a bilinear system bls introducing the control laws including the quadratic nonlinear and optimal feedback control laws into the bls it is found that the eddycurrent damper can be used to suppress flexible and shear vibrations simultaneously and the system is globally asymptotically stable numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis hsub 2 optimization of the threeelement type dynamic vibration absorbers the dynamic vibration absorber dva is a passive vibration control device which is attached to a vibrating body called a primary system subjected to exciting force or motion in this paper we will discuss an optimization problem of the threeelement type dva on the basis of the hsub 2 optimization criterion the objective of the hsub 2 optimization is to reduce the total vibration energy of the system for overall frequencies the total area under the power spectrum response curve is minimized in this criterion if the system is subjected to random excitation instead of sinusoidal excitation then the hsub 2 optimization is probably more desirable than the popular hsub infinity  optimization in the past decade there has been increasing interest in the threeelement type dva however most previous studies on this type of dva were based on the hsub infinity  optimization design and no one has been able to find the algebraic solution as of yet we found a closedform exact solution for a special case where the primary system has no damping furthermore the general case solution including the damped primary system is presented in the form of a numerical solution the optimum parameters obtained here are compared to those of the conventional voigt type dva they are also compared to other optimum parameters based on the hsub infinity  criterion nonlinear control of a shape memory alloy actuated manipulator this paper presents a nonlinear robust control algorithm for accurate positioning of a single degree of freedom rotary manipulator actuated by shape memory alloy sma a model for an sma actuated manipulator is presented the model includes nonlinear dynamics of the manipulator a constitutive model of shape memory alloy and electrical and heat transfer behavior of sma wire this model is used for open and closed loop motion simulations of the manipulator experiments are presented that show results similar to both closed and open loop simulation results due to modeling uncertainty and nonlinear behavior of the system classic control methods such as proportionalintegralderivative control are not able to present fast and accurate performance hence a nonlinear robust control algorithm is presented based on variable structure control this algorithm is a control gain switching technique based on the weighted average of position and velocity feedbacks this method has been designed through simulation and tested experimentally results show fast accurate and robust performance of the control system computer simulation and experimental results for different stabilization and tracking situations are also presented a stochastic averaging approach for feedback control design of nonlinear systems under random excitations this paper presents a method for designing and quantifying the performance of feedback stochastic controls for nonlinear systems the design makes use of the method of stochastic averaging to reduce the dimension of the state space and to derive the ito stochastic differential equation for the response amplitude process the moment equation of the amplitude process closed by the rayleigh approximation is used as a means to characterize the transient performance of the feedback control the steady state and transient response of the amplitude process are used as the design criteria for choosing the feedback control gains numerical examples are studied to demonstrate the performance of the control the analysis and control of longitudinal vibrations from wave viewpoint the analysis and control of longitudinal vibrations in a rod from feedback wave viewpoint are synthesized both collocated and noncollocated feedback wave control strategies are explored the control design is based on the local properties of wave transmission and reflection in the vicinity of the control force applied area hence there is no complex closed form solution involved the controller is designed to achieve various goals such as absorbing the incoming vibration energy creating a vibration free zone and eliminating standing waves in the structure the findings appear to be very useful in practice due to the simplicity in the implementation of the controllers design of an adaptive vibration absorber to reduce electrical transformer structural vibration this paper considers the design of a vibration absorber to reduce structural vibration at multiple frequencies with an enlarged bandwidth control at these target frequencies while the basic absorber is a passive device a control system has been added to facilitate tuning effectively giving the combination of a passive and active device which leads to far greater stability and robustness experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the absorber are also described crone control principles and extension to timevariant plants with asymptotically constant coefficients the principles of crone control a frequencydomain robust control design methodology based on fractional differentiation are presented continuous timevariant plants with asymptotically constant coefficients are analysed in the frequency domain through their representation using timevariant frequency responses a stability theorem for feedback systems including timevariant plants with asymptotically constant coefficients is proposed finally crone control is extended to robust control of these plants fractional differentiation in passive vibration control from a singledegreeoffreedom model used to illustrate the concept of vibration isolation a method to transform the design for a suspension into a design for a robust controller is presented fractional differentiation is used to model the viscoelastic behaviour of the suspension the use of fractional differentiation not only permits optimisation of just four suspension parameters showing the compactness of the fractional derivative operator but also leads to robustness of the suspensions performance to uncertainty of the sprung mass as an example an engine suspension is studied chaotic phenomena and fractionalorder dynamics in the trajectory control of redundant manipulators redundant manipulators have some advantages when compared with classical arms because they allow the trajectory optimization both on the free space and on the presence of obstacles and the resolution of singularities for this type of arms the proposed kinematic control algorithms adopt generalized inverse matrices but in general the corresponding trajectory planning schemes show important limitations motivated by these problems this paper studies the chaos revealed by the pseudoinversebased trajectory planning algorithms using the theory of fractional calculus fractional motion control application to an xy cutting table in path tracking design the dynamic of actuators must be taken into account in order to reduce overshoots appearing for small displacements a new approach to path tracking using fractional differentiation is proposed with its application on a xy cutting table it permits the generation of optimal movement referenceinput leading to a minimum path completion time taking into account both maximum velocity acceleration and torque and the bandwidth of the closedloop system fractional differentiation is used here through a davidsoncole filter a methodology aiming at improving the accuracy especially on checkpoints is presented the referenceinput obtained is compared with spline function both are applied to an xy cutting table model and actuator outputs compared analogue realizations of fractionalorder controllers an approach to the design of analogue circuits implementing fractionalorder controllers is presented the suggested approach is based on the use of continued fraction expansions in the case of negative coefficients in a continued fraction expansion the use of negative impedance converters is proposed several possible methods for obtaining suitable rational approximations and continued fraction expansions are discussed an example of realization of a fractionalorder isup lambda  controller is presented and illustrated by obtained measurements the suggested approach can be used for the control of very fast processes where the use of digital controllers is difficult or impossible using fractional order adjustment rules and fractional order reference models in modelreference adaptive control this paper investigates the use of fractional order calculus foc in conventional model reference adaptive control mrac systems two modifications to the conventional mrac are presented ie the use of fractional order parameter adjustment rule and the employment of fractional order reference model through examples benefits from the use of foc are illustrated together with some remarks for further research a suggestion of fractionalorder controller for flexible spacecraft attitude control a controller design method for flexible spacecraft attitude control is proposed the system is first described by a partial differential equation with internal damping then the frequency response is analyzed and the three basic characteristics of the flexible system namely average function lower bound and upper bound are defined on this basis a fractionalorder controller is proposed which functions as phase stabilization control for lower frequency and smoothly enters to amplitude stabilization at higher frequency by proper amplitude attenuation it is shown that the equivalent damping ratio increases in proportion to the square of frequency dynamics and control of initialized fractionalorder systems due to the importance of historical effects in fractionalorder systems this paper presents a general fractionalorder system and control theory that includes the timevarying initialization response previous studies have not properly accounted for these historical effects the initialization response along with the forced response for fractionalorder systems is determined the scalar fractionalorder impulse response is determined and is a generalization of the exponential function stability properties of fractionalorder systems are presented in the complex wplane which is a transformation of the splane time responses are discussed with respect to pole positions in the complex wplane and frequency response behavior is included a fractionalorder vector space representation which is a generalization of the state space concept is presented including the initialization response control methods for vector representations of initialized fractionalorder systems are shown finally the fractionalorder differintegral is generalized to continuous orderdistributions which have the possibility of including all fractional orders in a transfer function parallel and distributed haskells parallel and distributed languages specify computations on multiple processors and have a computation language to describe the algorithm ie what to compute and a coordination language to describe how to organise the computations across the processors haskell has been used as the computation language for a wide variety of parallel and distributed languages and this paper is a comprehensive survey of implemented languages it outlines parallel and distributed language concepts and classifies haskell extensions using them similar example programs are used to illustrate and contrast the coordination languages and the comparison is facilitated by the common computation language a lazy language is not an obvious choice for parallel or distributed computation and we address the question of why haskell is a common functional computation language a typed representation for html and xml documents in haskell we define a family of embedded domain specific languages for generating html and xml documents each language is implemented as a combinator library in haskell the generated htmlxml documents are guaranteed to be wellformed in addition each library can guarantee that the generated documents are valid xml documents to a certain extent for html only a weaker guarantee is possible on top of the libraries haskell serves as a meta language to define parameterized documents to map structured documents to htmlxml to define conditional content or to define entire web sites the combinator libraries support elementtransforming style a programming style that allows programs to have

for three or more parties sharing an entangled state the dimension of each subsystem being an even integer d the simplest example that goes beyond the standard ghz paradox three qubits involves five ququats d  4 we then examine the criteria that a ghz paradox must satisfy in order to be genuinely m partite and d dimensional secrets of the glasgow haskell compiler inliner higherorder languages such as haskell encourage the programmer to build abstractions by composing functions a good compiler must inline many of these calls to recover an efficiently executable program in principle inlining is dead simple just replace the call of a function by an instance of its body but any compilerwriter will tell you that inlining is a black art full of delicate compromises that work together to give good performance without unnecessary code bloat the purpose of this paper is therefore to articulate the key lessons we learned from a fullscale production inliner the one used in the glasgow haskell compiler we focus mainly on the algorithmic aspects but we also provide some indicative measurements to substantiate the importance of various aspects of the inliner faking it simulating dependent types in haskell dependent types reflect the fact that validity of data is often a relative notion by allowing prior data to affect the types of subsequent data not only does this make for a precise type system but also a highly generic one both the type and the program for each instance of a family of operations can be computed from the data which codes for that instance recent experimental extensions to the haskell type class mechanism give us strong tools to relativize types to other types we may simulate some aspects of dependent typing by making counterfeit typelevel copies of data with type constructors simulating data constructors and type classes simulating datatypes this paper gives examples of the technique and discusses its potential developing a highperformance web server in concurrent haskell server applications and in particular networkbased server applications place a unique combination of demands on a programming language lightweight concurrency high io throughput and fault tolerance are all important this paper describes a prototype web server written in concurrent haskell with extensions and presents two useful results firstly a conforming server could be written with minimal effort leading to an implementation in less than 1500 lines of code and secondly the naive implementation produced reasonable performance furthermore making minor modifications to a few timecritical components improved performance to a level acceptable for anything but the most heavily loaded web servers a static semantics for haskell this paper gives a static semantics for haskell 98 a nonstrict purely functional programming language the semantics formally specifies nearly all the details of the haskell 98 type system including the resolution of overloading kind inference including defaulting and polymorphic recursion the only major omission being a proper treatment of ambiguous overloading and its resolution overloading is translated into explicit dictionary passing as in all current implementations of haskell the target language of this translation is a variant of the girardreynolds polymorphic lambda calculus featuring higher order polymorphism and explicit type abstraction and application in the term language translated programs can thus still be type checked although the implicit version of this system is impredicative a surprising result of this formalization effort is that the monomorphism restriction when rendered in a system of inference rules compromises the principal type property choice preferences without inferences subconscious priming of risk attitudes we present a procedure for subconscious priming of risk attitudes in experiment 1 we were reliably able to induce riskseeking or riskaverse preferences across a range of decision scenarios using this priming procedure in experiment 2 we showed that these priming effects can be reversed by drawing participants attention to the priming event our results support claims that the formation of risk preferences can be based on preconscious processing as for example postulated by the affective primacy hypothesis rather than rely on deliberative mental operations as posited by several current models of judgment and decision making a reexamination of probability matching and rational choice in a typical probability learning task participants are presented with a repeated choice between two response alternatives one of which has a higher payoff probability than the other rational choice theory requires that participants should eventually allocate all their responses to the highpayoff alternative but previous research has found that people fail to maximize their payoffs instead it is commonly observed that people match their response probabilities to the payoff probabilities we report three experiments on this choice anomaly using a simple probability learning task in which participants were provided with i large financial incentives ii meaningful and regular feedback and iii extensive training in each experiment large proportions of participants adopted the optimal response strategy and all three of the factors mentioned above contributed to this the results are supportive of rational choice theory eliminating recency with selfreview the case of auditors going concern judgments this paper examines the use of selfreview to debias recency recency is found in the going concern judgments of staff auditors but is successfully eliminated by the auditors use of a simple selfreview technique that would be extremely easy to implement in audit practice auditors who selfreview are also less inclined to make audit report choices that are inconsistent with their going concern judgments these results are important because the judgments of staff auditors often determine the type and extent of documentation in audit workpapers and serve as preliminary inputs for senior auditors judgments and choices if staff auditors judgments are affected by recency the impact of this bias may be impounded in the ultimate judgments and choices of senior auditors since biased judgments can expose auditors to significant costs involving extended audit procedures legal liability and diminished reputation simple debiasing techniques that reduce this exposure are valuable the paper also explores some future research needs and other important issues concerning judgment debiasing in applied professional settings acceptance of a price discount the role of the semantic relatedness between purchases and the comparative price format two studies are reported where people are asked to accept or not a price reduction on a target product in the high low relative saving version the regular price of the target product is low high in both versions the absolute value of the price reduction is the same as well as the total of regular prices of planned purchases as first reported by tversky and kahneman 1981 findings show that the majority of people accept the price discount in the highrelative saving version whereas the minority do it in the low one in study 1 findings show that the previous preference reversal disappears when planned purchases are strongly related also a previously unreported preference reversal is found the majority of people accept the price discount when the products are weakly related whereas the minority accept when the products are strongly related in study 2 findings show that the classic preference reversal disappears as a function of the comparative price format also another previously unreported preference reversal is found when the offered price reduction relates to a lowpriced product people are more inclined to accept it with a control than a minimal comparative price format findings reported in studies 1 and 2 are interpreted in terms of mental accounting shifts bigger is better the influence of physical size on aesthetic preference judgments the hypothesis that the physical size of an object can influence aesthetic preferences was investigated in a series of four experiments participants were presented with pairs of abstract stimuli and asked to indicate which member of each pair they preferred a preference for larger stimuli was found on the majority of trials using various types of stimuli stimuli of various sizes and with both adult and 3yearold participants this preference pattern was disrupted only when participants had both stimuli that provided a readily accessible alternative source of preferenceevoking information and sufficient attentional resources to make their preference judgments mustering motivation to enact decisions how decision process characteristics influence goal realization decision scientists tend to focus mainly on decision antecedents studying how people make decisions action psychologists in contrast study postdecision issues investigating how decisions once formed are maintained protected and enacted through the research presented here we seek to bridge these two disciplines proposing that the process by which decisions are reached motivates subsequent pursuit and benefits eventual realization we identify three characteristics of the decision process dp as having motivationmustering potential dp effort investment dp importance and dp confidence through two field studies tracking participants decision processes pursuit and realization we find that after controlling for the influence of the motivational mechanisms of goal intention and implementation intention the three decision process characteristics significantly influence the successful enactment of the chosen decision directly the theoretical and practical implications of these findings are considered and future research opportunities are identified quantum zeno subspaces the quantum zeno effect is recast in terms of an adiabatic theorem when the measurement is described as the dynamical coupling to another quantum system that plays the role of apparatus a few significant examples are proposed and their practical relevance discussed we also focus on decoherencefree subspaces variety identification of wheat using mass spectrometry with neural networks and the influence of mass spectra processing prior to neural network analysis the performance of matrixassisted laser desorptionionisation timeofflight mass spectrometry with neural networks in wheat variety classification is further evaluated two principal issues were studied a the number of varieties that could be classified correctly and b various means of preprocessing mass spectrometric data the number of wheat varieties tested was increased from 10 to 30 the main preprocessing method investigated was based on gaussian smoothing of the spectra but other methods based on normalisation procedures and multiplicative scatter correction of data were also used with the final method it was possible to classify 30 wheat varieties with 87 correctly classified mass spectra and a correlation coefficient of 090 abacus efi and antivirus the extensible firmware interface efi standard emerged as a logical step to provide flexibility and extensibility to boot sequence processes enabling the complete abstraction of a systems bios interface from the systems hardware in doing so this provided the means of standardizing a bootup sequence extending device drivers and boot time applications portability to non pcatbased architectures including embedded systems like internet appliances tv internet settop boxes and 64bit itanium platforms fidelity of quantum teleportation through noisy channels we investigate quantum teleportation through noisy quantum channels by solving analytically and numerically a master equation in the lindblad form we calculate the fidelity as a function of decoherence rates and angles of a state to be teleported it is found that the average fidelity and the range of states to be accurately teleported depend on types of noises acting on quantum channels if the quantum channels are subject to isotropic noise the average fidelity decays to 12 which is smaller than the best possible value of 23 obtained only by the classical communication on the other hand if the noisy quantum channel is modeled by a single lindblad operator the average fidelity is always greater than 23 operations that do not disturb partially known quantum states consider a situation in which a quantum system is secretly prepared in a state chosen from the known set of states we present a principle that gives a definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the system and those that disturb the states the principle is derived by alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a fundamental property of quantum ones the principle can be cast into a simple form by using a decomposition of the relevant hilbert space which is uniquely determined by the set of possible states the decomposition implies the classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state one storing it classically one storing it nonclassically and the other one storing no information then the principle states that the nonclassical part is inaccessible and the classical part is readonly if we are to preserve the state of the system from this principle many types of nocloning nobroadcasting and noimprinting conditions can easily be derived in general forms including mixed states it also gives a unified view on how various schemes of quantum cryptography work the principle helps one to derive optimum amount of resources bits qubits and ebits required in data compression or in quantum teleportation of mixedstate ensembles quantumcontrolled measurement device for quantumstate discrimination we propose a programmable quantum device that is able to perform a specific generalized measurement from a certain set of measurements depending on a quantum state of a program register in particular we study a situation when the programmable measurement device serves for the unambiguous discrimination between nonorthogonal states the particular pair of states that can be unambiguously discriminated is specified by the state of a program qubit the probability of successful discrimination is not optimal for all admissible pairs however for some subsets it can be very close to the optimal value quantum universal variablelength source coding we construct an optimal quantum universal variablelength code that achieves the admissible minimum rate ie our code is used for any probability distribution of quantum states its probability of exceeding the admissible minimum rate exponentially goes to 0 our code is optimal in the sense of its exponent in addition its average error asymptotically tends to 0 application of artificial intelligence to search groundstate geometry of clusters we introduce a global optimization procedure the neuralassisted genetic algorithm naga it combines the power of an artificial neural network ann with the versatility of the genetic algorithm this method is suitable to solve optimization problems that depend on some kind of heuristics to limit the search space if a reasonable amount of data is available the ann can understand the problem and provide the genetic algorithm with a selected population of elements that will speed up the search for the optimum solution we tested the method in a search for the groundstate geometry of silicon clusters we trained the ann with information about the geometry and energetics of small silicon clusters next the ann learned how to restrict the configurational space for larger silicon clusters for sisub 10 and sisub 20 we noticed that the naga is at least three times faster than the pure genetic algorithm as the size of the cluster increases it is expected that the gain in terms of time will increase as well quantuminformation processing by nuclear magnetic resonance experimental implementation of halfadder and subtractor operations using an oriented spin72 system the advantages of using quantum systems for performing many computational tasks have already been established several quantum algorithms have been developed which exploit the inherent property of quantum systems such as superposition of states and entanglement for efficiently performing certain tasks the experimental implementation has been achieved on many quantum systems of which nuclear magnetic resonance has shown the largest progress in terms of number of qubits this paper describes the use of a spin72 as a threequbit system and experimentally implements the halfadder and subtractor operations the required qubits are realized by partially orienting sup 133cs nuclei in a liquidcrystalline medium yielding a quadrupolar split wellresolved septet another feature of this paper is the proposal that labeling of quantum states of system can be suitably chosen to increase the efficiency of a computational task quantum phase gate for photonic qubits using only beam splitters and postselection we show that a beam splitter of reflectivity onethird can be used to realize a quantum phase gate operation if only the outputs conserving the number of photons on each side are postselected entangling atoms in bad cavities we propose a method to produce entangled spin squeezed states of a large number of atoms inside an optical cavity by illuminating the atoms with bichromatic light the coupling to the cavity induces pairwise exchange of excitations which entangles the atoms unlike most proposals for entangling atoms by cavity qed our proposal does not require the strong coupling regime gsup 2 kappa gamma 1 where g is the atom cavity coupling strength kappa is the cavity decay rate and gamma is the decay rate of the atoms in this work the important parameter is ngsup 2 kappa gamma  where n is the number of atoms and our proposal permits the production of entanglement in bad cavities as long as they contain a large number of atoms deterministic singlephoton source for distributed quantum networking a sequence of single photons is emitted on demand from a single threelevel atom strongly coupled to a highfinesse optical cavity the photons are generated by an adiabatically driven stimulated raman transition between two atomic ground states with the vacuum field of the cavity stimulating one branch of the transition and laser pulses deterministically driving the other branch this process is unitary and therefore intrinsically reversible which is essential for quantum communication and networking and the photons should be appropriate for alloptical quantum information processing universal simulation of hamiltonian dynamics for quantum systems with finitedimensional state spaces what interactions are sufficient to simulate arbitrary quantum dynamics in a composite quantum system dodd et al phys rev a 65 040301r 2002 provided a partial solution to this problem in the form of an efficient algorithm to simulate any desired twobody hamiltonian evolution using any fixed twobody entangling nqubit hamiltonian and local unitaries we extend this result to the case where the component systems are qudits that is have d dimensions as a consequence we explain how universal quantum computation can be performed with any fixed twobody entangling nqudit hamiltonian and local unitaries dense coding in entangled states we consider the dense coding of entangled qubits shared between two parties alice and bob the efficiency of classical information gain through quantum entangled qubits is also considered for the case of pairwise entangled qubits and maximally entangled qubits we conclude that using the pairwise entangled qubits can be more efficient when two parties communicate whereas using the maximally entangled qubits can be more efficient when the n parties communicate quantumstate information retrieval in a rydbergatom data register we analyze a quantum search protocol to retrieve phase information from a rydbergatom data register using a subpicosecond halfcycle electric field pulse calculations show that the halfcycle pulse can perform the phase retrieval only within a range of peak field values by varying the phases of the constituent orbitals of the rydberg wave packet register we demonstrate coherent control of the phase retrieval process by specially programming the phases of the orbitals comprising the initial wave packet we show that it is possible to use the search method as a way to synthesize single energy eigenstates quantum retrodiction in open systems quantum retrodiction involves finding the probabilities for various preparation events given a measurement event this theory has been studied for some time but mainly as an interesting concept associated with time asymmetry in quantum mechanics recent interest in quantum communications and cryptography however has provided retrodiction with a potential practical application for this purpose quantum retrodiction in open systems should be more relevant than in closed systems isolated from the environment in this paper we study retrodiction in open systems and develop a general master equation for the backward time evolution of the measured state which can be used for calculating preparation probabilities we solve the master equation by way of example for the driven twolevel atom coupled to the electromagnetic field inhibiting decoherence via ancilla processes general conditions are derived for preventing the decoherence of a single twostate quantum system qubit in a thermal bath the employed auxiliary systems required for this purpose are merely assumed to be weak for the general condition while various examples such as extra qubits and extra classical fields are studied for applications in quantum information processing the general condition is confirmed by well known approaches toward inhibiting decoherence an approach to decoherencefree quantum memories and quantum operations is presented by placing the qubit into the center of a sphere with extra qubits on its surface numerical simulation of information recovery in quantum computers decoherence is the main problem to be solved before quantum computers can be built to control decoherence it is possible to use error correction methods but these methods are themselves noisy quantum computation processes in this work we study the ability of steanes and shors faulttolerant recovering methods as well as a modification of steanes ancilla network to correct errors in qubits we test a way to measure correctly ancillas fidelity for these methods and state the possibility of carrying out an effective error correction through a noisy quantum channel even using noisy error correction methods delayedchoice entanglement swapping with vacuumonephoton quantum states we report the experimental realization of a recently discovered quantuminformation protocol by peres implying an apparent nonlocal quantum mechanical retrodiction effect the demonstration is carried out by a quantum optical method by which each singlet entangled state is physically implemented by a twodimensional subspace of fock states of a mode of the electromagnetic field specifically the space spanned by the vacuum and the onephoton state along lines suggested recently by e knill et al nature london 409 46 2001 and by m duan et al ibid 414 413 2001 quantum learning and universal quantum matching machine suppose that three kinds of quantum systems are given in some unknown states fsup xn gsub 1sup xk and gsub 2sup xk and we want to decide which template state gsub 1 or gsub 2 each representing the feature of the pattern class csub 1 or csub 2 respectively is closest to the input feature state f this is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric family of pure qubit systems we derive two kinds of matching strategies the first one is a semiclassical strategy that is obtained by the natural extension of conventional matching strategies and consists of a twostage procedure identification estimation of the unknown template states to design the classifier learning process to train the classifier and classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on the estimated results the other is a fully quantum strategy without any intermediate measurement which we might call as the universal quantum matching machine we present the bayes optimal solutions for both strategies in the case of k1 showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum matching procedure that is strictly superior to the straightforward semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the learning process action aggregation and defuzzification in mamdanitype fuzzy systems discusses the issues of action aggregation and defuzzification in mamdanitype fuzzy systems the paper highlights the shortcomings of defuzzification techniques associated with the customary interpretation of the sentence connective and by means of the set union operation these include loss of smoothness of the output characteristic and inaccurate mapping of the fuzzy response the most appropriate procedure for aggregating the outputs of different fuzzy rules and converting them into crisp signals is then suggested the advantages in terms of increased transparency and mapping accuracy of the fuzzy response are demonstrated a novel robot hand with embedded shape memory alloy actuators describes the development of an active robot hand which allows smooth and lifelike motions for anthropomorphic grasping and fine manipulations an active robot finger 10 mm in outer diameter with a shape memory alloy sma wire actuator embedded in the finger with a constant distance from the geometric centre of the finger was designed and fabricated the practical specifications of the sma wire and the flexible rod were determined on the basis of a series of formulae the active finger consists of two bending parts the sma actuators and a connecting part the mechanical properties of the bending part are investigated the control system on the basis of resistance feedback is also presented finally a robot hand with three fingers was designed and the grasping experiment was carried out to demonstrate its performance exploiting randomness in quantum information processing we consider how randomness can be made to play a useful role in quantum information processingin particular for decoherence control and the implementation of quantum algorithms for a twolevel system in which the decoherence channel is nondissipative we show that decoherence suppression is possible if memory is present in the channel random switching between two potentially harmful noise sources can then provide a source of stochastic control such random switching can also be used in an advantageous way for the implementation of quantum algorithms carcaravan snaking 2 active caravan braking for part 1 see ibid p70722 founded on the review and results of part 1 part 2 contains a description of the virtual design of an active braking system for caravans or other types of trailer to suppress snaking vibrations while being simple from a practical viewpoint the design process and the design itself are explained the performance is examined by simulations and it is concluded that the system is effective robust and realizable with modest and available components stability of wmethods with applications to operator splitting and to geometric theory we analyze the stability properties of wmethods applied to the parabolic initial value problem u  au  bu we work in an abstract banach space setting assuming that a is the generator of an analytic semigroup and that b is relatively bounded with respect to a since wmethods treat the term with a implicitly whereas the term involving b is discretized in an explicit way they can be regarded as splitting methods as an application of our stability results convergence for nonsmooth initial data is shown moreover the layout of a geometric theory for discretizations of semilinear parabolic problems u  au  f u is presented numerical approximation of nonlinear bvps by means of bvms boundary value methods bvms would seem to be suitable candidates for the solution of nonlinear boundary value problems bvps they have been successfully used for solving linear bvps together with a mesh selection strategy based on the conditioning of the linear systems our aim is to extend this approach so as to use them for the numerical approximation of nonlinear problems for this reason we consider the quasilinearization technique that is an application of the newton method to the nonlinear differential equation consequently each iteration requires the solution of a linear bvp in order to guarantee the convergence to the solution of the continuous nonlinear problem it is necessary to determine how accurately the linear bvps must be solved for this goal suitable stopping criteria on the residual and on the error for each linear bvp are given numerical experiments on stiff problems give rather satisfactory results showing that the experimental code called tom that uses a class of bvms and the quasilinearization technique may be competitive with well known solvers for bvps differential algebraic systems anew it is proposed to figure out the leading term in differential algebraic systems more precisely low index linear systems with those properly stated leading terms are considered in detail in particular it is asked whether a numerical integration method applied to the original system reaches the inherent regular ode without conservation ie whether the discretization and the decoupling commute in some sense in general one cannot expect this commutativity so that additional difficulties like strong stepsize restrictions may arise moreover abstract differential algebraic equations in infinitedimensional hilbert spaces are introduced and the index notion is generalized to those equations in particular partial differential algebraic equations are considered in this abstract formulation on quasilinear pdaes with convection applications indices numerical solution for a class of partial differential algebraic equations pdaes of quasilinear type which include nonlinear terms of convection type a possibility to determine a time and spatial index is considered as a typical example we investigate an application from plasma physics especially we discuss the numerical solution of initial boundary value problems by means of a corresponding finite difference splitting procedure which is a modification of a wellknown fractional step method coupled with a matrix factorization the convergence of the numerical solution towards the exact solution of the corresponding initial boundary value problem is investigated some results of a numerical solution of the plasma pdae are given a variablestepsize variableorder multistep method for the integration of perturbed linear problems g scheifele 1971 wrote the solution of a perturbed oscillator as an expansion in terms of a new set of functions which extends the monomials in the taylor series of the solution recently p martin and jm ferrandiz 1997 constructed a multistep code based on the scheifele technique and it was generalized by dj lopez and p martin 1998 for perturbed linear problems however the remarked codes are constant steplength methods and efficient integrators must be able to change the steplength in this paper we extend the ideas of ft krogh 1974 from adams methods to the algorithm proposed by lopez and martin and we show the advantages of the new code in perturbed problems some recent advances in validated methods for ivps for odes compared to standard numerical methods for initial value problems ivps for ordinary differential equations odes validated methods often called interval methods for ivps for odes have two important advantages if they return a solution to a problem then 1 the problem is guaranteed to have a unique solution and 2 an enclosure of the true solution is produced we present a brief overview of interval taylor series its methods for ivps for odes and discuss some recent advances in the theory of validated methods for ivps for odes in particular we discuss an interval hermiteobreschkoff iho scheme for computing rigorous bounds on the solution of an ivp for an ode the stability of its and iho methods and a new perspective on the wrapping effect where we interpret the problem of reducing the wrapping effect as one of finding a more stable scheme for advancing the solution implementation of dimsims for stiff differential systems some issues related to the implementation of diagonally implicit multistage integration methods for stiff differential systems are discussed they include reliable estimation of the local discretization error construction of continuous interpolants solution of nonlinear systems of equations by simplified newton iterations choice of initial stepsize and order and step and order changing strategy numerical results are presented which indicate that an experimental matlab code based on type 2 methods of order one two and three outperforms ode15s code from matlab ode suite on problems whose jacobian has eigenvalues which are close to the imaginary axis parallel implicit predictor corrector methods the performance of parallel codes for the solution of initial value problems is usually strongly sensitive to the dimension of the continuous problem this is due to the overhead related to the exchange of information among the processors and motivates the problem of minimizing the amount of communications according to this principle we define the so called parallel implicit predictor corrector methods and in this class we derive astable lstable and numerically zerostable formulas the latter property refers to the zerostability condition of a given formula when roundoff errors are introduced in its coefficients due to their representation in finite precision arithmetic some numerical experiment show the potentiality of this approach accuracy and stability of splitting with stabilizing corrections this paper contains a convergence analysis for the method of stabilizing corrections which is an internally consistent splitting scheme for initialboundary value problems to obtain more accuracy and a better treatment of explicit terms several extensions are regarded and analyzed the relevance of the theoretical results is tested for convectiondiffusionreaction equations an entanglement measure based on the capacity of dense coding an asymptotic entanglement measure for any bipartite states is derived in the light of the dense coding capacity optimized with respect to local quantum operations and classical communications general properties and some examples with explicit forms of this entanglement measure are investigated on the contractivity of implicitexplicit linear multistep methods this paper is concerned with the class of implicitexplicit linear multistep methods for the numerical solution of initial value problems for ordinary differential equations which are composed of stiff and nonstiff parts we study the contractivity of such methods with regard to linear autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations and a scaled euclidean norm in addition we derive a strong stability result based on the stability regions of these methods carcaravan snaking 1 the influence of pintle pin friction a brief review of knowledge of carcaravan snaking is carried out against the background described a fairly detailed mathematical model of a contemporary cartrailer system is constructed and a baseline set of parameter values is given in reduced form the model is shown to give results in accordance with literature the properties of the baseline combination are explored using both linear and nonlinear versions of the model the influences of damping at the pintle joint and of several other design parameters on the stability of the linear system in the neighbourhood of the critical snaking speed are calculated and discussed coulomb friction damping at the pintle pin is then included and simulations are used to indicate the consequent amplitudedependent behaviour the friction damping especially when its level has to be chosen by the user is shown to give dangerous characteristics despite having some capacity for stabilization of the snaking motions it is concluded that pintle pin friction damping does not represent a satisfactory solution to the snaking problem the paper sets the scene for the development of an improved solution ride quality evaluation of an activelycontrolled stretcher for an ambulance this study considers the subjective evaluation of ride quality during ambulance transportation using an activelycontrolled stretcher acs the ride quality of a conventional stretcher and an assistant drivers seat is also compared braking during ambulance transportation generates negative foottohead acceleration in patients and causes blood pressure to rise in the patients head the acs absorbs the foottohead acceleration by changing the angle of the stretcher thus reducing the blood pressure variation however the ride quality of the acs should be investigated further because the movement of the acs may cause motion sickness and nausea experiments of ambulance transportation including rapid acceleration and deceleration are performed to evaluate the effect of differences in posture of the transported subject on the ride quality the semantic differential method and factor analysis are used in the investigations subjects are transported using a conventional stretcher with head forward a conventional stretcher with head backward the acs and an assistant drivers seat for comparison with transportation using a stretcher experimental results show that the acs gives the most comfortable transportation when using a stretcher moreover the reduction of the negative foottohead acceleration at frequencies below 02 hz and the small variation of the foottohead acceleration result in more comfortable transportation conventional transportation with the head forward causes the worst transportation although the characteristics of the vibration of the conventional stretcher seem to be superior to that of the acs a fuzzy logic approach to accommodate thermal stress and improve the startup phase in combined cycle power plants use of combined cycle power generation plant has increased dramatically over the last decade a supervisory control approach based on a dynamic model is developed which makes use of proportionalintegralderivative pid fuzzy logic and fuzzy pid schemes the aim is to minimize the steam turbine plant startup time without violating maximum thermal stress limits an existing startup schedule provides the benchmark by which the performance of candidate controllers is assessed improvements regarding possible reduced startup times and satisfaction of maximum thermal stress restrictions have been realized using the proposed control scheme efficient allocation of knowledge in distributed business structures accelerated business processes demand new concepts and realizations of information systems and knowledge databases this paper presents the concept of the collaborative information space cis which supplies the necessary tools to transform individual knowledge into collective useful information the creation of information objects in the cis allows an efficient allocation of information in all business process steps at any time furthermore the specific availability of heterogeneous distributed data is realized by a webbased user interface which enables effective search by a multidimensionally hierarchical composition development of a realtime monitoring system this paper describes a pattern recognition pr technique which uses learning vector quantization lvq this method is adapted for practical application to solve problems in the area of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis where a number of fault signatures are involved in these situations the aim is health monitoring including identification of deterioration of the healthy condition and identification of causes of the failure in realtime for this reason a fault database is developed which contains the collected information about various states of operation of the system in the form of pattern vectors the task of the realtime monitoring system is to correlate patterns of unknown faults with the known fault signatures in the fault database this will determine cause of failure and degree of deterioration of the system under test the problem of fault diagnosis may involve a large number of patterns and large sampling time which affects the learning stage of neural networks the study here also aims to find a fast learning model of neural networks for instances when a high number of patterns and numerous processing elements are involved it begins searching for an appropriate solution the study is extended to the enforcement learning models and considers lvq as a network emerged from the competitive learning model through enforcement training finally tests show an accuracy of 923 per cent in the fault diagnostic capability of the technique evaluating alternative manufacturing control strategies using a benchmark system this paper describes an investigation of the effects of dynamic job routing and job sequencing decisions on the performance of a distributed control system and its adaptability against disturbances this experimental work was carried out to compare the performance of alternative control strategies in various manufacturing environments and to investigate the relationship between the control and controlled systems the experimental testbed presented in this paper consists of an agentbased control system implemented in c and a discreteevent simulation model using this testbed various control strategies were tested on a benchmark manufacturing system by varying production volumes to model the production system with loosertighter schedules and disturbance frequencies it was found that hybrid strategies that combine reactive agent mechanisms and allocation strategies such as the contract net with appropriate job sequencing heuristics provide the best performance particularly when job congestion increases on a shopfloor a study on an automatic seam tracking system by using an electromagnetic sensor for sheet metal arc welding of butt joints many sensors such as the vision sensor and the laser displacement sensor have been developed to automate the arc welding process however these sensors have some problems due to the effects of arc light fumes and spatter an electromagnetic sensor which utilizes the generation of an eddy current was developed for detecting the weld line of a butt joint in which the root gap size was zero an automatic seam tracking system designed for sheet metal arc welding was constructed with a sensor through experiments it was revealed that the system had an excellent seam tracking accuracy of the order of or02 mm instability phenomena in the gasmetal arc welding selfregulation process arc instability is a very important determinant of weld quality the instability behaviour of the gasmetal arc welding gmaw process is characterized by strong oscillations in arc length and current in the paper a model of the gmaw process is developed using an exact arc voltage characteristic this model is used to study stability of the selfregulation process and to develop a simulation program that helps to understand the transient or dynamic nature of the gmaw process and relationships among current electrode extension and contact tubework distance the process is shown to exhibit instabilities at both long electrode extension and normal extension results obtained from simulation runs of the model were also experimentally confirmed by the present author as reported in this study in order to explain the concept of the instability phenomena the metal transfer mode and the arc voltagecurrent characteristic were examined based on this examination the conclusion of this study is that their combined effects lead to the oscillations in arc current and length webcad a computer aided design tool constrained with explicit design for manufacturability rules for computer numerical control milling a key element in the overall efficiency of a manufacturing enterprise is the compatibility between the features

developed the system restricts the freedom of the designer in such a way that the designed parts can be manufactured on a threeaxis computer numerical control milling machine this paper discusses the vision of webcad and explains the rationale for its development in comparison with commercial cadcam computer aided designmanufacture systems the paper then goes on to describe the implementation issues that enforce the manufacturability rules finally certain design tools are described that aid a user during the design process some examples are given of the parts designed and manufactured with webcad does social capital determine innovation to what extent this paper deals with two questions does social capital determine innovation in manufacturing firms if it is the case to what extent to deal with these questions we review the literature on innovation in order to see how social capital came to be added to the other forms of capital as an explanatory variable of innovation in doing so we have been led to follow the dominating view of the literature on social capital and innovation which claims that social capital cannot be captured through a single indicator but that it actually takes many different forms that must be accounted for therefore to the traditional explanatory variables of innovation we have added five forms of structural social capital business network assets information network assets research network assets participation assets and relational assets and one form of cognitive social capital reciprocal trust in a context where empirical investigations regarding the relations between social capital and innovation are still scanty this paper makes contributions to the advancement of knowledge in providing new evidence regarding the impact and the extent of social capital on innovation at the two decisionmaking stages considered in this study a switching synchronization scheme for a class of chaotic systems in this letter we propose an observerbased synchronization scheme for a class of chaotic systems this class of systems are given by piecewiselinear dynamics by using some properties of such systems we give a procedure to construct the gain of the observer we prove various stability results and comment on the robustness of the proposed scheme we also present some simulation results evaluation of existing and new feature recognition algorithms 2 experimental results for pt1 see ibid p839851 this is the second of two papers investigating the performance of generalpurpose feature detection techniques the first paper describes the development of a methodology to synthesize possible general feature detection face sets six algorithms resulting from the synthesis have been designed and implemented on a sun workstation in c using acis as the geometric modelling system in this paper extensive tests and comparative analysis are conducted on the feature detection algorithms using carefully selected components from the public domain mostly from the national design repository the results show that the new and enhanced algorithms identify face sets that previously published algorithms cannot detect the tests also show that each algorithm can detect among other types a certain type of feature that is unique to it hence most of the algorithms discussed in this paper would have to be combined to obtain complete coverage evaluation of existing and new feature recognition algorithms 1 theory and implementation this is the first of two papers evaluating the performance of generalpurpose feature detection techniques for geometric models in this paper six different methods are described to identify sets of faces that bound depression and protrusion faces each algorithm has been implemented and tested on eight components from the national design repository the algorithms studied include previously published generalpurpose feature detection algorithms such as the singleface innerloop and concavity techniques others are improvements to existing algorithms such as extensions of the twodimensional convex hull method to handle curved faces as well as protrusions lastly new algorithms based on the threedimensional convex hull minimum concave visible and multipleface innerloop face sets are described design and implementation of a reusable and extensible hl7 encodingdecoding framework the health level seven hl7 an international standard for electronic data exchange in all health care environments enables disparate computer applications to exchange key sets of clinical and administrative information above all it defines the standard hl7 message formats prescribed by the standard encoding rules in this paper we propose a flexible reusable and extensible hl7 encoding and decoding framework using a message object model mom and message definition repository mdr the mom provides an abstract hl7 message form represented by a group of objects and their relationships it reflects logical relationships among the standard hl7 message elements such as segments fields and components while enforcing the key structural constraints imposed by the standard since the mom completely eliminates the dependency of the hl7 encoder and decoder on platformspecific data formats it makes it possible to build the encoder and decoder as reusable standalone software components enabling the interconnection of arbitrary heterogeneous hospital information systems his with little effort moreover the mdr an external database of key definitions for hl7 messages helps make the encoder and decoder as resilient as possible to future modifications of the standard hl7 message formats it is also used by the encoder and decoder to perform a wellformedness check for their respective inputs ie hl7 message objects expressed in the mom and encoded hl7 message strings although we implemented a prototype version of the encoder and decoder using java they can be easily packaged and delivered as standalone components using the standard component frameworks new age computing autonomic computing autonomic computing ac sometimes called selfmanaged computing is the name chosen by ibm to describe the companys new initiative aimed at making computing more reliable and problemfree it is a response to a growing realization that the problem today with computers is not that they need more speed or have too little memory but that they crash all too often this article reviews current initiatives being carried out in the ac field by the it industry followed by key challenges which require to be addressed in its development and implementation a 3stage pipelined architecture for multiview images decoder in this paper we proposed the architecture of the decoder which implements the multiview images decoding algorithm the study of the hardware structure of the multiview image processing has not been accomplished the proposed multiview images decoder operates in a three stage pipelined manner and extracts the depth of the pixels of the decoded image every clock the multiview images decoder consists of three modules node selector which transfers the value of the nodes repeatedly and depth extractor which extracts the depth of each pixel from the four values of the nodes and affine transformer which generates the projecting position on the image plane from the values of the pixels and the specified viewpoint the proposed architecture is designed and simulated by the maxplusii design tool and the operating frequency is 30 mhz the image can be constructed in a real time by the decoder with the proposed architecture fuzzy business halden reactor project the halden reactor project has developed two systems to investigate how signal validation and thermal performance monitoring techniques can be improved peano is an online calibration monitoring system that makes use of artificial intelligence techniques the system has been tested in cooperation with epri and edan engineering using real data from a us pwr plant these tests showed that peano could reliably assess the performance of the process instrumentation at different plant conditions real cases of zero and span drifts were successfully detected by the system tempo is a system for thermal performance monitoring and optimisation which relies on plantwide first principle models the system has been installed on a swedish bwr plant results obtained show an overall rms deviation from measured values of a few tenths of a percent and giving goodnessoffits in the order of 95 the high accuracy demonstrated is a good basis for detecting possible faults and efficiency losses in steam turbine cycles virtual projects at halden reactor project the halden manmachine systems mms programme for 2002 is intended to address issues related to human factors control room design computerbased support system areas and system safety and reliability the halden mms programme is intended to address extensive experimental work in the human factors control room design and computerbased support system areas the work is based on experiments and demonstrations carried out in the experimental facility hammlab pilotversions of several operator aids are adopted and integrated to the hammlab simulators and demonstrated in a full dynamic setting the halden virtual reality laboratory has recently become an integral and important part of the programme a knowledgenavigation system for dimensional metrology geometric dimensioning and tolerancing gdt is a method to specify the dimensions and form of a part so that it will meet its design intent gdt is difficult to master for two main reasons first it is based on complex 3d geometric entities and relationships second the geometry is associated with a large diverse knowledge base of dimensional metrology with many interconnections this paper describes an approach to create a dimensional metrology knowledge base that is organized around a set of key concepts and to represent those concepts as virtual objects that can be navigated with interactive computer visualization techniques to access the associated knowledge the approach can enable several applications first is the application to convey the definition and meaning of gdt over a broad range of tolerance types second is the application to provide a visualization of dimensional metrology knowledge within a control hierarchy of the inspection process third is the application to show the coverage of interoperability standards to enable industry to make decisions on standards development and harmonization efforts a prototype system has been implemented to demonstrate the principles involved in the approach the visible cement data set with advances in xray microtomography it is now possible to obtain threedimensional representations of a materials microstructure with a voxel size of less than one micrometer the visible cement data set represents a collection of 3d data sets obtained using the european synchrotron radiation facility in grenoble france in september 2000 most of the images obtained are for hydrating portland cement pastes with a few data sets representing hydrating plaster of paris and a common building brick all of these data sets are being made available on the visible cement data set website at httpvisiblecementnistgov the website includes the raw 3d datafiles a description of the material imaged for each data set example twodimensional images and visualizations for each data set and a collection of c language computer programs that will be of use in processing and analyzing the 3d microstructural images this paper provides the details of the experiments performed at the esrf the analysis procedures utilized in obtaining the data set files and a few representative example images for each of the three materials investigated the existence condition of gamma acyclic database schemes with mvds constraints it is very important to use database technology for a largescale system such as erp and mis a good database design may improve the performance of the system some research shows that a gamma acyclic database scheme has many good properties eg each connected join expression is monotonous which helps to improve query performance of the database system thus what conditions are needed to generate a gamma acyclic database scheme for a given relational scheme in this paper the sufficient and necessary condition of the existence of gamma acyclic joinlossless and dependenciespreserved database schemes meeting 4nf is given modification for synchronization of rossler and chen chaotic systems active control is an effective method for making two identical rossler and chen systems be synchronized however this method works only for a certain class of chaotic systems with known parameters both in drive systems and response systems modification based on lyapunov stability theory is proposed in order to overcome this limitation an adaptive synchronization controller which can make the states of two identical rossler and chen systems globally asymptotically synchronized in the presence of systems unknown constant parameters is derived especially when some unknown parameters are positive we can make the controller more simple besides the controller is independent of those positive uncertain parameters at last when the condition that arbitrary unknown parameters in two systems are identical constants is cancelled we demonstrate that it is possible to synchronize two chaotic systems all results are proved using a wellknown lyapunov stability theorem numerical simulations are given to validate the proposed synchronization approach a hybrid model for smoke simulation a smoke simulation approach based on the integration of traditional particle systems and density functions is presented in this paper by attaching a density function to each particle as its attribute the diffusion of smoke can be described by the variation of particles density functions along with the effect on airflow by controlling particles movement and fragmentation in addition a continuous density field for realistic rendering can be generated quickly through the lookup tables of particles density functions compared with traditional particle systems this approach can describe smoke diffusion and provide a continuous density field for realistic rendering with much less computation a quick rendering scheme is also presented in this paper as a useful preview tool for tuning appropriate parameters in the smoke model the contiguity in rm an re degree c is contiguous if degsub wttadegsub wttb for any re sets ab in c in this paper we generalize the notation of contiguity to the structure rm the upper semilattice of the re degree set r modulo the cappable re degree set m an element c in rm is contiguous if degsub wttadegsub wttb for any re sets a b such that degsub tadegsub tb in c it is proved in this paper that every nonzero element in rm is not contiguous ie for every element c in rm if c noto then there exist at least two re sets a b such that degsub ta degsub tb in c and degsub wtta notdegsub wttb blending parametric patches with subdivision surfaces in this paper the problem of blending parametric surfaces using subdivision patches is discussed a new approach named removingboundary is presented to generate piecewisesmooth subdivision surfaces through discarding the outmost quadrilaterals of the open meshes derived by each subdivision step then the approach is employed both to blend parametric bicubic bspline surfaces and to fill nsided holes it is easy to produce piecewisesmooth subdivision surfaces with both convex and concave corners on the boundary and limit surfaces are guaranteed to be csup 2 continuous on the boundaries except for a few singular points by the removingboundary approach thus the blending method is very efficient and the blending surface generated is of good effect word spotting based on a posterior measure of keyword confidence in this paper an approach of keyword confidence estimation is developed that well combines acoustic layer scores and syllablebased statistical language model lm scores an a posteriori ap confidence measure and its forwardbackward calculating algorithm are deduced a zero false alarm zfa assumption is proposed for evaluating relative confidence measures by word spotting task in a word spotting experiment with a vocabulary of 240 keywords the keyword accuracy under the ap measure is above 94 which well approaches its theoretical upper limit in addition a syllable lattice hidden markov model slhmm is formulated and a unified view of confidence estimation word spotting optimal path search and nbest syllable rescoring is presented the proposed ap measure can be easily applied to various speech recognition systems as well a new algebraic modelling approach to distributed problemsolving in mas this paper is devoted to a new algebraic modelling approach to distributed problemsolving in multiagent systems mas which is featured by a unified framework for describing and treating social behaviors social dynamics and social intelligence a conceptual architecture of algebraic modelling is presented the algebraic modelling of typical social behaviors social situation and social dynamics is discussed in the context of distributed problemsolving in mas the comparison and simulation on distributed task allocations and resource assignments in mas show more advantages of the algebraic approach than other conventional methods fourpoint wavelets and their applications multiresolution analysis mra and wavelets provide useful and efficient tools for representing functions at multiple levels of details wavelet representations have been used in a broad range of applications including image compression physical simulation and numerical analysis in this paper the authors construct a new class of wavelets called fourpoint wavelets based on an interpolatory fourpoint subdivision scheme they are of local support symmetric and stable the analysis and synthesis algorithms have linear time complexity depending on different weight parameters w the scaling functions and wavelets generated by the fourpoint subdivision scheme are of different degrees of smoothness therefore the user can select better wavelets relevant to the practice among the classes of wavelets the authors apply the fourpoint wavelets in signal compression the results show that the fourpoint wavelets behave much better than bspline wavelets in many situations an interlinguabased chineseenglish mt system chineseenglish machine translation is a significant and challenging problem in information processing the paper presents an interlinguabased chineseenglish natural language translation system icent it introduces the realization mechanism of chinese language analysis which contains syntactic parsing and semantic analyzing and gives the design of interlingua in details experimental results and system evaluation are given the result is satisfying an attackfinding algorithm for security protocols this paper proposes an automatic attack construction algorithm in order to find potential attacks on security protocols it is based on a dynamic strand space model which enhances the original strand space model by introducing active nodes on strands so as to characterize the dynamic procedure of protocol execution with exact causal dependency relations between messages considered in the model this algorithm can avoid state space explosion caused by asynchronous composition in order to get a finite state space a new method called strandadded on demand is exploited which extends a bundle in an incremental manner without requiring explicit configuration of protocol execution parameters a finer granularity model of term structure is also introduced in which subterms are divided into check subterms and data subterms moreover data subterms can be further classified based on the compatible data subterm relation to obtain automatically the finite set of valid acceptable terms for an honest principal in this algorithm terms core is designed to represent the intruders knowledge compactly and forward search technology is used to simulate attack patterns easily using this algorithm a new attack on the dolveyao protocol can be found which is even more harmful because the secret is revealed before the session terminates runtime dataflow analysis parallelizing compilers have made great progress in recent years however there still remains a gap between the current ability of parallelizing compilers and their final goals in order to achieve the maximum parallelism runtime techniques were used in parallelizing compilers during last few years first this paper presents a basic runtime privatization method the definition of runtime dead code is given and its side effect is discussed to eliminate the imprecision caused by the runtime dead code backward dataflow information must be used proteus test which can use backward information in runtime is then presented to exploit more dynamic parallelism also a variation of proteus test the advanced proteus test is offered to achieve partial parallelism proteus test was implemented on the parallelizing compiler aft in the end of this paper the program fppppf of spec95fp benchmark is taken as an example to show the effectiveness of proteus test a componentbased software configuration management model and its supporting system software configuration management scm is an important key technology in software development componentbased software development cbsd is an emerging paradigm in software development however to apply cbsd effectively in real world practice supporting scm in cbsd needs to be further investigated in this paper the objects that need to be managed in cbsd is analyzed and a componentbased scm model is presented in this model components as the integral logical constituents in a system are managed as the basic configuration items in scm and the relationships betweenamong components are defined and maintained based on this model a configuration management system is implemented revisiting hardys paradox counterfactual statements real measurements entanglement and weak values hardys 1992 paradox is revisited usually the paradox is dismissed on grounds of counterfactuality ie because the paradoxical effects appear only when one considers results of experiments which do not actually take place we suggest a new set of measurements in connection with hardys scheme and show that when they are actually performed they yield strange and surprising outcomes more generally we claim that counterfactual paradoxes point to a deeper structure inherent to quantum mechanics an effective feedback control mechanism for diffserv architecture as a scalable qos quality of service architecture diffserv differentiated service mainly consists of two components traffic conditioning at the edge of the diffserv domain and simple packet forwarding inside the diffserv domain diffserv has many advantages such as flexibility scalability and simplicity but when providing af assured forwarding services diffserv has some problems such as unfairness among aggregated flows or among microflows belonging to an aggregated flow in this paper a feedback mechanism for af aggregated flows is proposed to solve this problem simulation results show that this mechanism does improve the performance of diffserv first it can improve the fairness among aggregated flows and make diffserv more friendly toward tcp transmission control protocol flows second it can decrease the buffer requirements at the congested router and thus obtain lower delay and packet loss rate third it also keeps almost the same link utility as in normal diffserv finally it is simple and easy to be implemented optimal bandwidth utilization of alloptical ring with a converter of degree 4 in many models of alloptical routing a set of communication paths in a network is given and a wavelength is to be assigned to each path so that paths sharing an edge receive different wavelengths the goal is to assign as few wavelengths as possible in order to use the optical bandwidth efficiently if a node of a network contains a wavelength converter any path that passes through this node may change its wavelength having converters at some of the nodes can reduce the number of wavelengths required for routing this paper presents a wavelength converter with degree 4 and gives a routing algorithm which shows that any routing with load l can be realized with l wavelengths when a node of an alloptical ring hosts such a wavelength converter it is also proved that 4 is the minimum degree of the converter to reach the full utilization of the available wavelengths if only one node of an alloptical ring hosts a converter hybrid broadcast for the videoondemand service multicast offers an efficient means of distributing video contentsprograms to multiple clients by batching their requests and then having them share a servers video stream batching customers requests is either clientinitiated or serverinitiated most advanced clientinitiated video multicasts are implemented by patching periodic broadcast a typical serverinitiated approach can be entiretybased or segmentbased this paper focuses on the performance of the vod service for popular videos first we analyze the limitation of conventional patching when the customer request rate is high then by combining the advantages of each of the two broadcast schemes we propose a hybrid broadcast scheme for popular videos which not only lowers the service latency but also improves clients interactivity by using an active buffering technique this is shown to be a good compromise for both lowering service latency and improving the vcrlike interactivity a transactional asynchronous replication scheme for mobile database systems in mobile database systems mobility of users has a significant impact on data replication as a result the various replica control protocols that exist today in traditional distributed and multidatabase environments are no longer suitable to solve this problem a new mobile database replication scheme the transactionlevel resultset propagation tlrsp model is put forward in this paper the conflict detection and resolution strategy based on tlrsp is discussed in detail and the implementation algorithm is proposed in order to compare the performance of the tlrsp model with that of other mobile replication schemes we have developed a detailed simulation model experimental results show that the tlrsp model provides an efficient support for replicated mobile database systems by reducing reprocessing overhead and maintaining database consistency data extraction from the web based on predefined schema with the development of the internet the world wide web has become an invaluable information source for most organizations however most documents available from the web are in html form which is originally designed for document formatting with little consideration of its contents effectively extracting data from such documents remains a nontrivial task in this paper we present a schemaguided approach to extracting data from html pages under the approach the user defines a schema specifying what to be extracted and provides sample mappings between the schema and the html page the system will induce the mapping rules and generate a wrapper that takes the html page as input and produces the required data in the form of xml conforming to the userdefined schema a prototype system implementing the approach has been developed the preliminary experiments indicate that the proposed semiautomatic approach is not only easy to use but also able to produce a wrapper that extracts required data from inputted pages with high accuracy structure of weakly invertible semiinputmemory finite automata with delay 1 semiinputmemory finite automata a kind of finite automata introduced by the first author of this paper for studying error propagation are a generalization of input memory finite automata by appending an autonomous finite automaton component in this paper we give a characterization of the structure of weakly invertible semiinputmemory finite automata with delay 1 in which the state graph of each autonomous finite automaton is a cycle from a result on mutual invertibility of finite automata obtained by the authors recently it leads to a characterization of the structure of feedforward inverse finite automata with delay 1 a note on an axiomatization of the core of market games as shown by peleg 1993 the core of market games is characterized by nonemptiness individual rationality superadditivity the weak reduced game property the converse reduced game property and weak symmetry it was not known whether weak symmetry was logically independent with the help of a certain transitive 4person tu game it is shown that weak symmetry is redundant in this result hence the core on market games is axiomatized by the remaining five properties if the universe of players contains at least four members repeated games with lack of information on one side the dual differential approach we introduce the dual differential game of a repeated game with lack of information on one side as the natural continuous time version of the dual game introduced by de meyer 1996 a traditional way to study the value of differential games is through discrete time approximations here we follow the opposite approach we identify the limit value of a repeated game in discrete time as the value of a differential game namely we use the recursive structure for the finitely repeated version of the dual game to construct a differential game for which the upper values of the uniform discretization satisfy precisely the same property the value of the dual differential game exists and is the unique viscosity solution of a firstorder derivative equation with a limit condition we identify the solution by translating viscosity properties in the primal the semialgebraic theory of stochastic games the asymptotic behavior of the minmax value of a finitestate zerosum discounted stochastic game as the discount rate approaches 0 has been studied in the past using the theory of realclosed fields we use the theory of semialgebraic sets and mappings to prove some asymptotic properties of the minmax value which hold uniformly for all stochastic games in which the number of states and players actions are predetermined to some fixed values as a corollary we prove a uniform polynomial convergence rate of the value of the nstage game to the value of the nondiscount game over a bounded set of payoffs computing stationary nash equilibria of undiscounted singlecontroller stochastic games given a twoperson nonzerosum stochastic game where the second player controls the transitions we formulate a linear complementarity problem lcpq m whose solution gives a nash equilibrium pair of stationary strategies under the limiting average payoff criterion the matrix m constructed is of the copositive class so that lemkes algorithm will process it we will also do the same for a special class of nperson stochastic games called polymatrix stochastic games quantum limit on computational time and speed we investigate if physical laws can impose limits on computational time and speed of a quantum computer built from elementary particles we show that the product of the speed and the running time of a quantum computer is limited by the type of fundamental interactions present inside the system this will help us to decide as to what type of interaction should be allowed in building quantum computers in achieving the desired speed nodecapacitated ring routing we consider the nodecapacitated routing problem in an undirected ring network along with its fractional relaxation the nodecapacitated multicommodity flow problem for the feasibility problem farkas lemma provides a characterization for general undirected graphs asserting roughly that there exists such a flow if and only if the socalled distance inequality holds for every choice of distance functions arising from nonnegative node weights for rings this straightforward result will be improved in two ways we prove that independent of the integrality of node capacities it suffices to require the distance inequality only for distances arising from 012valued node weights a requirement that will be called the doublecut condition moreover for integervalued node capacities the doublecut condition implies the existence of a halfintegral multicommodity flow in this case there is even an integervalued multicommodity flow that violates each node capacity by at most one our approach gives rise to a combinatorial strongly polynomial algorithm to compute either a violating doublecut or a nodecapacitated multicommodity flow a relation of the problem to its edgecapacitated counterpart will also be explained a minmax theorem on feedback vertex sets we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the linear system x  hx or e x or 0 associated with a bipartite tournament to be totally dual integral where h is the cyclevertex incidence matrix and e is the allone vector the consequence is a minmax relation on packing and covering cycles together with strongly polynomial time algorithms for the feedback vertex set problem and the cycle packing problem on the corresponding bipartite tournaments in addition we show that the feedback vertex set problem on general bipartite tournaments is npcomplete and approximable within 35 based on the minmax theorem semidefinite programming vs lp relaxations for polynomial programming we consider the global minimization of a multivariate polynomial on a semialgebraic set omega defined with polynomial inequalities we then compare two hierarchies of relaxations namely lp relaxations based on products of the original constraints in the spirit of the rlt procedure of sherali and adams 1990 and recent semidefinite programming sdp relaxations introduced by the author the comparison is analyzed in light of recent results in real algebraic geometry on various representations of polynomials positive on a compact semialgebraic set an analytic center cutting plane method for semidefinite feasibility problems semidefinite feasibility problems arise in many areas of operations research the abstract form of these problems can be described as finding a point in a nonempty bounded convex body gamma in the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices assume that gamma is defined by an oracle which for any given m  m symmetric positive semidefinite matrix gamma either confirms that y epsilon gamma or returns a cut ie a symmetric matrix a such that gamma is in the halfspace y  a  y or a  y we study an analytic center cutting plane algorithm for this problem at each iteration the algorithm computes an approximate analytic center of a working set defined by the cutting plane system generated in the previous iterations if this approximate analytic center is a solution then the algorithm terminates otherwise the new cutting plane returned by the oracle is added into the system as the number of iterations increases the working set shrinks and the algorithm eventually finds a solution to the problem all iterates generated by the algorithm are positive definite matrices the algorithm has a worstcase complexity of omsup 3 epsilon sup 2 on the total number of cuts to be used where epsilon is the maximum radius of a ball contained by gamma relationship between strong monotonicity property psub 2property and the gusproperty in semidefinite linear complementarity problems in a recent paper on semidefinite linear complementarity problems gowda and song 2000 introduced and studied the pproperty psub 2property gusproperty and strong monotonicity property for linear transformation l ssup n to ssup n where ssup n is the space of all symmetric and real n  n matrices in an attempt to characterize the psub 2property they raised the following two questions i does the strong monotonicity imply the psub 2property ii does the gusproperty imply the psub 2property in this paper we show that the strong monotonicity property implies the psub 2property for any linear transformation and describe an equivalence between these two properties for lyapunov and other transformations we show by means of an example that the gusproperty need not imply the psub 2property even for lyapunov transformations a combinatorial graphbased solution method for a class of continuoustime optimal control problems the paper addresses a class of continuoustime optimal control problems whose solutions are typically characterized by both bangbang and singular control regimes analytical study and numerical computation of such solutions are very difficult and far from complete when only techniques from control theory are used this paper solves optimal control problems by reducing them to the combinatorial search for the shortest path in a specially constructed graph since the nodes of the graph are weighted in a sequencedependent manner we extend the classical shortestpath algorithm to our case the proposed solution method is currently limited to singlestate problems with multiple control functions a production planning problem and a train operation problem are optimally solved to illustrate the method qlearning for risksensitive control we propose for risksensitive control of finite markov chains a counterpart of the popular qlearning algorithm for classical markov decision processes the algorithm is shown to converge with probability one to the desired solution the proof technique is an adaptation of the ode approach for the analysis of stochastic approximation algorithms with most of the work involved used for the analysis of the specific odes that arise on deciding stability of constrained homogeneous random walks and queueing systems we investigate stability of scheduling policies in queueing systems to this day no algorithmic characterization exists for checking stability of a given policy in a given queueing system in this paper we introduce a certain generalized priority policy and prove that the stability of this policy is algorithmically undecidable we also prove that stability of a homogeneous random walk in lsub sup d is undecidable finally we show that the problem of computing a fluid limit of a queueing system or of a constrained homogeneous random walk is undecidable to the best of our knowledge these are the first undecidability results in the area of stability of queueing systems and random walks in lsub sup d we conjecture that stability of common policies like firstinfirstout and priority policy is also an undecidable problem approximating martingales for variance reduction in markov process simulation knowledge of either analytical or numerical approximations should enable more efficient simulation estimators to be constructed this principle seems intuitively plausible and certainly attractive yet no completely satisfactory general methodology has been developed to exploit it the authors present a new approach for obtaining variance reduction in markov process simulation that is applicable to a vast array of different performance measures the approach relies on the construction of a martingale that is then used as an internal control variate development and evaluation of a casebased reasoning classifier for prediction of breast biopsy outcome with biradssup tm lexicon approximately 7085 of breast biopsies are performed on benign lesions to reduce this high number of biopsies performed on benign lesions a casebased reasoning cbr classifier was developed to predict biopsy results from biradssup tm findings we used 1433 931 benign biopsyproven mammographic cases cbr similarity was defined using either the hamming or euclidean distance measure over case features ten features represented each case calcification distribution calcification morphology calcification number mass margin mass shape mass density mass size associated findings special cases and age performance was evaluated using round robin sampling receiver operating characteristic roc analysis and bootstrap to determine the most influential features for the cbr an exhaustive feature search was performed over all possible feature combinations 1022 and similarity thresholds influential features were defined as the most frequently occurring features in the feature subsets with the highest partial roc areas sub 090auc for cbr with hamming distance the most influential features were found to be mass margin calcification morphology age calcification distribution calcification number and mass shape resulting in an sub 090auc of 033 at 95 sensitivity the hamming cbr would spare from biopsy 34 of the benign lesions at 98 sensitivity the hamming cbr would spare 27 benign lesions for the cbr with euclidean distance the most influential feature subset consisted of mass margin calcification morphology age mass density and associated findings resulting in sub 090auc of 037 at 95 sensitivity the euclidean cbr would spare from biopsy 41 benign lesions at 98 sensitivity the euclidean cbr would spare 27 benign lesions the profile of cases spared by both distance measures at 98 sensitivity indicates that the cbr is a potentially useful diagnostic tool for the classification of mammographic lesions by recommending shortterm followup for likely benign lesions that is in agreement with final biopsy results and mammographers intuition cooperative three and fourplayer quantum games a cooperative multiplayer quantum game played by 3 and 4 players has been studied a quantum superposed operator is introduced in this work which solves the nonzero sum difficulty in previous treatments the role of quantum entanglement of the initial state is discussed in detail computer aided classification of masses in ultrasonic mammography frequency compounding was recently investigated for computer aided classification of masses in ultrasonic bmode images as benign or malignant the classification was performed using the normalized parameters of the nakagami distribution at a single region of interest at the site of the mass a combination of normalized nakagami parameters from two different images of a mass was undertaken to improve the performance of classification receiver operating characteristic roc analysis showed that such an approach resulted in an area of 083 under the roc curve the aim of the work described in this paper is to see whether a feature describing the characteristic of the boundary can be extracted and combined with the nakagami parameter to further improve the performance of classification the combination of the features has been performed using a weighted summation results indicate a 10 improvement in specificity at a sensitivity of 96 after combining the information at the site and at the boundary moreover the technique requires minimal clinical intervention and has a performance that reaches that of the trained radiologist it is hence suggested that this technique may be utilized in practice to characterize breast masses reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position purpose in breast conserving therapy complete excision of the tumor with an acceptable cosmetic outcome depends on accurate localization in terms of both the position of the lesion and its extent we hypothesize that preoperative contrastenhanced magnetic resonance mr imaging of the patient in a supine position may be used for accurate tumor localization and marking of its extent immediately prior to surgery our aims in this study are to assess the reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position to evaluate the effect of a breast immobilization device and to derive reproducibility margins that take internal tissue shifts into account occurring between repeat setups materials methods the reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position is estimated by quantification of tissue shifts in the breasts of healthy volunteers between repeat mr setups for each volunteer fiducials are identified and registered with their counter locations in corresponding mr volumes the difference in position denotes the shift of breast tissue the dependence on breast volume and the part of the breast as well as the effect of a breast immobilization cast are studied results the tissue shifts are small with a mean standard deviation on the order of 15 mm being slightly larger in large breasts v1000 cmsup 3 and in the posterior part toward the pectoral muscle of both small and large breasts the application of a breast immobilization cast reduces the tissue shifts in large breasts a reproducibility margin on the order of 5 mm will take the internal tissue shifts into account that occur between repeat setups conclusion the results demonstrate a high reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position fast and accurate leaf verification for dynamic multileaf collimation using an electronic portal imaging device a prerequisite for accurate dose delivery of imrt profiles produced with dynamic multileaf collimation dmlc is highly accurate leaf positioning in our institution leaf verification for dmlc was initially done with film and ionization chamber to overcome the limitations of these methods a fast accurate and twodimensional method for daily leaf verification using our ccdcamera based electronic portal imaging device epid has been developed this method is based on a flat field produced with a 05 cm wide sliding gap for each leaf pair deviations in gap widths are detected as deviations in gray scale value profiles derived from the epid images and not by directly assessing leaf positions in the images dedicated software was developed to reduce the noise level in the low signal images produced with the narrow gaps the accuracy of this quality assurance procedure was tested by introducing known leaf position errors it was shown that errors in leaf gap as small as 001002 cm could be detected which is certainly adequate to guarantee accurate dose delivery of dmlc treatments even for strongly modulated beam profiles using this method it was demonstrated that both short and long term reproducibility in leaf positioning were within 001 cm 1 sigma  for all gantry angles and that the effect of gravity was negligible a threesource model for the calculation of head scatter factors accurate determination of the head scatter factor ssub c is an important issue especially for intensity modulated radiation therapy where the segmented fields are often very irregular and much less than the collimator jaw settings in this work we report an ssub c calculation algorithm for symmetric asymmetric and irregular open fields shaped by the tertiary collimator a multileaf collimator or blocks at different sourcetochamber distance the algorithm was based on a threesource model in which the photon radiation to the point of calculation was treated as if it originated from three effective sources one source for the primary photons from the target and two extrafocal photon sources for the scattered photons from the primary collimator and the flattening filter respectively the field mapping method proposed by kim et al phys med biol 43 15931604 1998 was extended to two extrafocal source planes and the scatter contributions were integrated over the projected areas determined by the detectors eye view in the three source planes considering the source intensity distributions the algorithm was implemented using microsoft visual cc in the ms windows environment the only input data required were head scatter factors for symmetric square fields which are normally acquired during machine commissioning a large number of different fields were used to evaluate the algorithm and the results were compared with measurements we found that most of the calculated ssub cs agreed with the measured values to within 04 the algorithm can also be easily applied to deal with irregular fields shaped by a multileaf collimator that replaces the upper or lower collimator jaws simultaneous iterative reconstruction of emission and attenuation images in positron emission tomography from emission data only for quantitative image reconstruction in positron emission tomography attenuation correction is mandatory in case that no data are available for the calculation of the attenuation correction factors one can try to determine them from the emission data alone however it is not clear if the information content is sufficient to yield an adequate attenuation correction together with a satisfactory activity distribution therefore we determined the log likelihood distribution for a thorax phantom depending on the choice of attenuation and activity pixel values to measure the crosstalk between both in addition an iterative image reconstruction onedimensional newtontype algorithm with a maximum likelihood estimator which simultaneously reconstructs the images of the activity distribution and the attenuation coefficients is used to demonstrate the problems and possibilities of such a reconstruction as result we show that for a change of the log likelihood in the range of statistical noise the associated change in the activity value of a structure is between 6 and 263 in addition we show that it is not possible to choose the best maximum on the basis of the log likelihood when a regularization is used because the coupling between different structures mediated by the smoothing regularization prevents an adequate solution due to crosstalk we conclude that taking into account the attenuation information in the emission data improves the performance of image reconstruction with respect to the bias of the activities however the reconstruction still is not quantitative mammogram synthesis using a 3d simulation ii evaluation of synthetic mammogram texture we have evaluated a method for synthesizing mammograms by comparing the texture of clinical and synthetic mammograms the synthesis algorithm is based upon simulations of breast tissue and the mammographic imaging process mammogram texture was synthesized by projections of simulated adipose tissue compartments it was hypothesized that the synthetic and clinical texture have similar properties assuming that the mammogram texture reflects the 3d tissue distribution the size of the projected compartments was computed by mathematical morphology the texture energy and fractal dimension were also computed and analyzed in terms of the distribution of texture features within four different tissue regions in clinical and synthetic mammograms comparison of the cumulative distributions of the mean features computed from 95 mammograms showed that the synthetic images simulate the mean features of the texture of clinical mammograms correlation of clinical and synthetic texture feature histograms averaged over all images showed that the synthetic images can simulate the range of features seen over a large group of mammograms the best agreement with clinical texture was achieved for simulated compartments with radii of 4133 mm in predominantly adipose tissue regions and radii of 27533 and 1327 mm in retroareolar and dense fibroglandular tissue regions respectively mammogram synthesis using a 3d simulation i breast tissue model and image acquisition simulation a method is proposed for generating synthetic mammograms based upon simulations of breast tissue and the mammographic imaging process a computer breast model has been designed with a realistic distribution of large and medium scale tissue structures parameters controlling the size and placement of simulated structures adipose compartments and ducts provide a method for consistently modeling images of the same simulated breast with modified position or acquisition parameters the mammographic imaging process is simulated using a compression model and a model of the xray image acquisition process the compression model estimates breast deformation using tissue elasticity parameters found in the literature and clinical force values the synthetic mammograms were generated by a mammogram acquisition model using a monoenergetic parallel beam approximation applied to the synthetically compressed breast phantom angular disparity in etact scintimammography emission tuned aperture computed tomography etact has been previously shown to have the potential for the detection of small tumors 1 cm in scintimammography however the optimal approach to the application of etact in the clinic has yet to be determined therefore we sought to determine the effect of the angular disparity between the etact projections on image quality through the use of a computer simulation a small spherical tumor of variable size 5 75 or 10 mm was placed at the center of a hemispherical breast 15 cm diameter the tumor to nontumor ratio was either 51 or 101 the detector was modeled to be a gamma camera fitted with a 4mmdiam pinhole collimator the pinholetodetector and the pinholetotumor distances were 25 and 15 cm respectively a ray tracing technique was used to generate three sets of projections 10 degrees  15 degrees  and 20 degrees  angular disparity these data were blurred to a resolution consistent with the 4 mm pinhole the tact reconstruction method was used to reconstruct these three image sets the tumor contrast and the axial spatial resolution was measured smaller angular disparity led to an improvement in image contrast but at a cost of degraded axial spatial resolution the improvement in contrast is due to a slight improvement in the inplane spatial resolution since improved contrast should lead to better tumor detectability smaller angular disparity should be used however the difference in contrast between 10 degrees and 15 degrees was very slight and therefore a reasonable clinical choice for angular disparity is 15 degrees benchmarking of the dose planning method dpm monte carlo code using electron beams from a racetrack microtron a comprehensive set of measurements and calculations has been conducted to investigate the accuracy of the dose planning method dpm monte carlo code for dose calculations from 10 and 50 mev scanned electron beams produced from a racetrack microtron central axis depth dose measurements and a series of profile scans at various depths were acquired in a water phantom using a scanditronix type rk ion chamber source spatial distributions for the monte carlo calculations were reconstructed from inair ion chamber measurements carried out across the twodimensional beam profile at 100 cm downstream from the source the inair spatial distributions were found to have full width at half maximum of 47 and 13 cm at 100 cm from the source for the 10 and 50 mev beams respectively energy spectra for the 10 and 50 mev beams were determined by simulating the components of the microtron treatment head using the code mcnp4b dpm calculations are on average within or2 agreement with measurement for all depth dose and profile comparisons conducted in this study the accuracy of the dpm code illustrated in this work suggests that dpm may be used as a valuable tool for electron beam dose calculations deterministic calculations of photon spectra for clinical accelerator targets a method is proposed to compute photon energy spectra produced in clinical electron accelerator targets based on the deterministic solution of the boltzmann equation for coupled electronphoton transport in onedimensional 1d slab geometry it is shown that the deterministic method gives similar results as monte carlo calculations over the angular range of interest for therapy applications relative energy spectra computed by deterministic and 3d monte carlo methods respectively are compared for several realistic target materials and different electron beams and are found to give similar photon energy distributions and mean energies the deterministic calculations typically require 12 mins of execution time on a sun workstation compared to 236 h for the monte carlo runs nonoptimal universal quantum deleting machine we verify the nonexistence of some standard universal quantum deleting machine then a nonoptimal universal quantum deleting machine is constructed and we emphasize the difficulty for improving its fidelity in a way our results complement the universal quantum cloning machine established by buzek and hillery 1996 and manifest some of their distinctions effect of multileaf collimator leaf width on physical dose distributions in the treatment of cns and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy the purpose of this work is to examine physical radiation dose differences between two multileaf collimator mlc leaf widths 5 and 10 mm in the treatment of cns and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt three clinical patients with cns tumors were planned with two different mlc leaf sizes 5 and 10 mm representing varian120 and varian80 millennium multileaf collimators respectively two sets of imrt treatment plans were developed the goal of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions the goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume treatment planning utilized the cadplanhelios system varian medical systems milpitas ca for dynamic mlc treatment delivery all beam parameters and optimization cost function parameters were identical for the 5 and 10 mm plans for all cases the number of beams gantry positions and table positions were taken from clinically treated threedimensional conformal radiotherapy plans conformality was measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target volume organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical structure receiving greater than 90 of the prescription dose vsub 90 for three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck t2t4 n0n2c m0 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams delivering a simultaneous integrated boost because modest differences in physical dose to the parotid were detected a ntcp model based upon the clinical parameters of eisbruch et al was then used for comparisons the conformality improved in all three cns cases for the 5 mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans for the organ avoidance plans vsub 90 also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf width was utilized for imrt treatment delivery in the third case both the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with none of the structure receiving more than 90 of the prescription dose but in the moderate dose range less dose was delivered to the critical structure with the 5 mm plan for the head and neck cases both the 5 and 1025 mm beamlets dmlc sliding window techniques spared the contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage the mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size 2104 gy vs 2236 gy the resulting average ntcp values were 1372 for 10 mm dmlc and 824 for 5 mm dmlc in conclusion five mm leaf width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases these differences may be most pronounced for single fraction radiosurgery or in cases where the tolerance of the sensitive organ is less than or close to the target volume prescription a method for geometrical verification of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy using a scanning electronic portal imaging device in order to guarantee the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy imrt verification of the leaf trajectories during the treatment is necessary our aim in this study is to develop a method for online verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning readout independent of the multileaf collimator examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices epids based on liquidfilled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon portal images were acquired continuously with a liquidfilled ionization chamber epid during the delivery together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator for each portal image the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row the aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge while the actual field edge is found using a maximumgradient edge detector the errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the reference field edge and the detected field edge earlier measurements of the dynamic epid response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm to ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand the method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions using the described method we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges verifying a single portal image took 01 s on an 866 mhz personal computer two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method first the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed indicating a delay of approximately 08 s in the control system second the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion in conclusion the described verification method is suitable for detailed verification of leaf trajectories during dynamic imrt incorporating multileaf collimator leaf sequencing into iterative imrt optimization intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt treatment planning typically considers beam optimization and beam delivery as separate tasks following optimization a multileaf collimator mlc or other beam delivery device is used to generate fluence patterns for patient treatment delivery due to limitations and characteristics of the mlc the deliverable intensity distributions often differ from those produced by the optimizer leading to differences between the delivered and the optimized doses objective function parameters are then adjusted empirically and the plan is reoptimized to achieve a desired deliverable dose distribution the resulting plan though usually acceptable may not be the best achievable a method has been developed to incorporate the mlc restrictions into the optimization process our inhouse imrt system has been modified to include the calculation of the deliverable intensity into the optimizer in this process prior to dose calculation the mlc leaf sequencer is used to convert intensities to dynamic mlc sequences from which the deliverable intensities are then determined all other optimization steps remain the same to evaluate the effectiveness of deliverablebased optimization 17 patient cases have been studied compared with standard optimization plus conversion to deliverable beams deliverablebased optimization results show improved isodose coverage and a reduced dose to critical structures deliverablebased optimization results are close to the original nondeliverable optimization results suggesting that imrt can overcome the mlc limitations by adjusting individual beamlets the use of deliverablebased optimization may reduce the need for empirical adjustment of objective function parameters and reoptimization of a plan to achieve desired results direct aperture optimization a turnkey solution for stepandshoot imrt imrt treatment plans for stepandshoot delivery have traditionally been produced through the optimization of intensity distributions or maps for each beam angle the optimization step is followed by the application of a leafsequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes in this article we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures we call this approach direct aperture optimization this technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery this is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the mlc are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leafsequencing step the leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm we have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the egs4beam monte carlo package for our dose calculation engine the results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal stepandshoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction as compared with traditional optimization strategies our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units direct aperture optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of imrt the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of dosevolume histograms of prostate sup 125i seed implants cumulative dosevolume histograms dvh are crucial in evaluating the quality of radioactive seed prostate implants when calculating dvhs the choice of voxel size is a compromise between computational speed larger voxels and accuracy smaller voxels we quantified the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of dvhs using an inhouse computer program the program was validated by comparison with a handcalculated dvh for a single 04u iodine125 model 6711 seed we used the program to find the voxel size required to obtain accurate dvhs of five iodine125 prostate implant patients at our institution onemillimeter cubes were sufficient to obtain dvhs that are accurate within 5 up to 200 of the prescription dose for the five patient plans we obtained good agreement with the variseed version 67 varian usa treatment planning softwares dvh algorithm by using voxels with a supinf dimension equal to the spacing between successive transverse seed implant planes 5 mm the volume that receives at least 200 of the target dose vsub 200 calculated by variseed was 30 to 43 larger than that calculated by our program with small voxels the singleseed dvh calculated by variseed fell below the hand calculation by up to 50 at low doses 30 gy and above it by over 50 at high doses 250 gy a leaf sequencing algorithm to enlarge treatment field length in imrt with mlcbased imrt the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the maximum field size for conventional treatments this is due to the constraints of the overtravel distances of mlc leaves andor jaws using a new leaf sequencing algorithm the usable imrt field length perpendicular to the mlc motion can be mostly made equal to the full length of the mlc field without violating the upper jaw overtravel limit for any given intensity pattern a criterion was proposed to assess whether an intensity pattern can be delivered without violation of the jaw position constraints if the criterion is met the new algorithm will consider the jaw position constraints during the segmentation for the step and shoot delivery method the strategy employed by the algorithm is to connect the intensity elements outside the jaw overtravel limits with those inside the jaw overtravel limits several methods were used to establish these connections during segmentation by modifying a previously published algorithm areal algorithm including changing the intensity level alternating the leafsequencing direction or limiting the segment field size the algorithm was tested with 1000 random intensity patterns with dimensions of 2127 cmsup 2 800 intensity patterns with higher intensity outside the jaw overtravel limit and three different types of clinical treatment plans that were undeliverable using a segmentation method from a commercial treatment planning system the new algorithm achieved a success rate of 100 with these test patterns for the 1000 random patterns the new algorithm yields a similar average number of segments of 369or29 in comparison to 366or13 when using the areal algorithm for the 800 patterns with higher intensities outside the jaw overtravel limits the new algorithm results in an increase of 25 in the average number of segments compared to the areal algorithm however the areal algorithm fails to create deliverable segments for 90 of these patterns using a single isocenter the new algorithm provides a solution to extend the usable imrt field length from 21 to 27 cm for imrt on a commercial linear accelerator using the step and shoot delivery method favorable noise uniformity properties of fourierbased interpolation and reconstruction approaches in singleslice helical computed tomography volumes reconstructed by standard methods from singleslice helical computed tomography ct data have been shown to have noise levels that are highly nonuniform relative to those in conventional ct these noise nonuniformities can affect lowcontrast object detectability and have also been identified as the cause of the zebra artifacts that plague maximum intensity projection mip images of such volumes while these spatially variant noise levels have their root in the peculiarities of the helical scan geometry there is also a strong dependence on the interpolation and reconstruction algorithms employed in this paper we seek to develop image reconstruction strategies that eliminate or reduce at its source the nonuniformity of noise levels in helical ct relative to that in conventional ct we pursue two approaches independently and in concert we argue and verify that fourierbased longitudinal interpolation approaches lead to more uniform noise ratios than do the standard 360li and 180li approaches we also demonstrate that a fourierbased fantoparallel rebinning algorithm used as an alternative to fanbeam filtered backprojection for slice reconstruction also leads to more uniform noise ratios even when making use of the 180li and 360li interpolation approaches portal dose image prediction for dosimetric treatment verification in radiotherapy ii an algorithm for wedged beams a method is presented for calculation of a twodimensional function tsub wedgexy describing the transmission of a wedged photon beam through a patient this in an extension of the method that we have published for open nonwedged fields med phys 25 830840 1998 transmission functions for open fields are being used in our clinic for prediction of portal dose images pdi ie a dose distribution behind the patient in a plane normal to the beam axis which are compared with pdis measured with an electronic portal imaging device epid the calculations are based on the planning ct scan of the patient and on the irradiation geometry as determined in the treatment planning process input data for the developed algorithm for wedged beams are derived from the already available measured input data set for transmission prediction in open beams which is extended with only a limited set of measurements in the wedged beam the method has been tested for a pdi plane at 160 cm from the focus in agreement with the applied focustodetector distance of our fluoroscopic epids for low and high energy photon beams 6 and 23 mv good agreement 1 has been found between calculated and measured transmissions for a slab and a thorax phantom from powder to perfect parts gkn sinter metals has increased productivity and quality by automating the powder metal lines that produce its transmission parts sigma admissible families over linear orders admissible sets of the form hypm where m is a recursively saturated system are treated we provide descriptions of subsets m which are sigma sub sets in hypm and of families of subsets m which form sigma regular families in hypm in terms of the concept of being fundamental couched in the article fundamental subsets and families are characterized for models of dense linear orderings frontier between separability and quantum entanglement in a many spin system we discuss the critical point xsub c separating the quantum entangled and separable states in two series of n spins s in the simple mixed state characterized by the matrix operator rho  x phi  phi 1xdsup nisub dn where x in 0 1 d  2s  1 isub dn is the dsup n  dsup n unity matrix and  phi  is a special entangled state the cases x  0 and x  1 correspond respectively to fully random spins and to a fully entangled state in the first of these series we consider special states  phi  invariant under charge conjugation that generalizes the n  2 spin s  12 einsteinpodolskyrosen state and in the second one we consider generalizations of the werner 1989 density matrices the evaluation of the critical point xsub c was done through bounds coming from the partial transposition method of peres 1996 and the conditional nonextensive entropy criterion our results suggest the conjecture that whenever the bounds coming from both methods coincide the result of xsub c is the exact one the results we present are relevant for the discussion of quantum computing teleportation and cryptography monoids all polygons over which are omega stable proof of the mustafinpoizat conjecture a monoid s is called an omega stabilizer superstabilizer or stabilizer if every spolygon has an omega stable superstable or stable theory it is proved that every omega stabilizer is a regular monoid this confirms the mustafinpoizat conjecture and allows us to end up the description of omega stabilizers model theory for hereditarily finite superstructures we study modeltheoretic properties of hereditarily finite superstructures over models of not more than countable signatures a question is answered in the negative inquiring whether theories of hereditarily finite superstructures which have a unique up to isomorphism hereditarily finite superstructure can be described via definable functions yet theories for such superstructures admit a description in terms of iterated families tf and sf these are constructed using a definable union taken over countable ordinals in the subsets which are unions of finitely many complete subsets and of finite subsets respectively simultaneously we describe theories that share a unique up to isomorphism countable hereditarily finite superstructure recognition of finite simple groups ssub 4q by their element orders it is proved that among

ncomputably enumerable sets we establish a number of results on numberings in particular on friedberg numberings of families of dce sets first it is proved that there exists a friedberg numbering of the family of all dce sets we also show that this result patterned on friedbergs famous theorem for the family of all ce sets holds for the family of all nce sets for any n  2 second it is stated that there exists an infinite family of dce sets without a friedberg numbering third it is shown that there exists an infinite family of ce sets treated as a family of dce sets with a numbering which is unique up to equivalence fourth it is proved that there exists a family of dce sets with a least numbering under reducibility which is friedberg but is not the only numbering modulo reducibility recognizing groups gsub 23sup n by their element orders it is proved that a finite group that is isomorphic to a simple nonabelian group g  gsub 23sup n is up to isomorphism recognized by a set omega

many realworld systems are multistate systems composed of multistate components in which the reliability can be computed in terms of the lower bound points of level d called dmincuts dmcs such systems electric power transportation etc may be regarded as flow networks whose arcs have independent discrete limited and multivalued random capacities in this paper all mcs are assumed to be known in advance and the authors focused on how to verify each dmc candidate before using dmcs to calculate the network reliability the proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing algorithms the algorithm runs in op sigma mn time a significant improvement over the previous op sigma msup 2 time bounds based on maxflowmincut where p and or are the number of mcs and dmc candidates respectively it is simple intuitive and uses no complex data structures an example is given to show how all dmc candidates are found and verified by the proposed algorithm then the reliability of this example is computed computing failure probabilities applications to reliability analysis the paper presents one method for calculating failure probabilities with applications to reliability analysis the method is based on transforming the initial set of variables to a ndimensional uniform random variable in the unit hypercube together with the limit condition set and calculating the associated probability using a recursive method based on the gausslegendre quadrature formulas to calculate the resulting multiple integrals an example of application is used to illustrate the proposed method an efficient algorithm for sequential generation of failure states in a network with multimode components in this work a new algorithm for the sequential generation of failure states in a network with multimode components is proposed the algorithm presented in the paper transforms the state enumeration problem into a kshortest paths problem taking advantage of the inherent efficiency of an algorithm for shortest paths enumeration and also of the characteristics of the reliability problem in which it will be used an algorithm with lower complexity than the best algorithm in the literature for solving this problem was obtained computational results will be presented for comparing the efficiency of both algorithms in terms of cpu time and for problems of different size multiresolution markov models for signal and image processing reviews a significant component of the rich field of statistical multiresolution mr modeling and processing these mr methods have found application and permeated the literature of a widely scattered set of disciplines and one of our principal objectives is to present a single coherent picture of this framework a second goal is to describe how this topic fits into the even larger field of mr methods and conceptsin particular making ties to topics such as wavelets and multigrid methods a third goal is to provide several alternate viewpoints for this body of work as the methods and concepts we describe intersect with a number of other fields the principle focus of our presentation is the class of mr markov processes defined on pyramidally organized trees the attractiveness of these models stems from both the very efficient algorithms they admit and their expressive power and broad applicability we show how a variety of methods and models relate to this framework including models for selfsimilar and 1f processes we also illustrate how these methods have been used in practice upper bound analysis of oblique cutting with nose radius tools a generalized upper bound model for calculating the chip flow angle in oblique cutting using flatfaced nose radius tools is described the projection of the uncut chip area on the rake face is divided into a number of elements parallel to an assumed chip flow direction the length of each of these elements is used to find the length of the corresponding element on the shear surface using the ratio of the shear velocity to the chip velocity the area of each element is found as the cross product of the length and its width along the cutting edge summing up the area of the elements along the shear surface the total shear surface area is obtained the friction area is calculated using the similarity between orthogonal and oblique cutting in the equivalent plane that includes both the cutting velocity and chip velocity the cutting power is obtained by summing the shear power and the friction power the actual chip flow angle and chip velocity are obtained by minimizing the cutting power with respect to both these variables the shape of the curved shear surface the chip cross section and the cutting force obtained from this model are presented manufacturing data analysis of machine tool errors within

manufacturing error diagnosis is achieved through the manufacturing data analysis of the results obtained from the inspection of the component on a coordinate measuring machine this manufacturing data analysis activity adopts a featurebased approach and is conducted through the application of a forward chaining expert system called the product data analysis distributed diagnostic expert system which forms part of a larger prototype feedback system entitled the production data analysis framework the paper introduces the manufacturing error categorisations that are associated with milling type operations knowledge acquisition and representation conceptual structure and operating procedure of the prototype manufacturing data analysis facility the paper concludes with a brief evaluation of the logic employed through the simulation of manufacturing error scenarios this prototype manufacturing data analysis expert system provides a valuable aid for the rapid diagnosis and elimination of manufacturing errors on a 3axis vertical machining centre in an environment where operator expertise is limited marble cutting with single point cutting tool and diamond segments an investigation has been undertaken into the frame sawing with diamond blades the kinematic behaviour of the frame sawing process is discussed under different cutting conditions cutting and indentingcutting tests are carried out by single point cutting tools and single diamond segments the results indicate that the depth of cut per diamond grit increases as the blades move forward only a few grits per segment can remove the material in the cutting process when the direction of the stroke changes the cutting forces do not decrease to zero because of the residual plastic deformation beneath the diamond grits the plastic deformation and fracture chipping of material are the dominant removal processes which can be explained by the fracture theory of brittle material indentation a comprehensive chatter prediction model for face turning operation including tool wear effect presents a threedimensional mechanistic frequency domain chatter model for face turning processes that can account for the effects of tool wear including process damping new formulations are presented to model the variation in process damping forces along nonlinear tool geometries such as the nose radius the underlying dynamic force model simulates the variation in the chip crosssectional area by accounting for the displacements in the axial and radial directions the model can be used to determine stability boundaries under various cutting conditions and different states of flank wear experimental results for different amounts of wear are provided as a validation for the model optimization of cutting conditions for single pass turning operations using a deterministic approach an optimization analysis strategy and cam software for the selection of economic cutting conditions in single pass turning operations are presented using a deterministic approach the optimization is based on criteria typified by the maximum production rate and includes a host of practical constraints it is shown that the deterministic optimization approach involving mathematical analyses of constrained economic trends and graphical representation on the feedspeed domain provides a clearly defined strategy that not only provides a unique global optimum solution but also the software that is suitable for online cam applications a numerical study has verified the developed optimization strategies and software and has shown the economic benefits of using optimization prediction of tool and chip temperature in continuous and interrupted machining a numerical model based on the finite difference method is presented to predict tool and chip temperature fields in continuous machining and time varying milling processes continuous or steady state machining operations like orthogonal cutting are studied by modeling the heat transfer between the tool and chip at the toolrake face contact zone the shear energy created in the primary zone the friction energy produced at the rake facechip contact zone and the heat balance between the moving chip and stationary tool are considered the temperature distribution is solved using the finite difference method later the model is extended to milling where the cutting is interrupted and the chip thickness varies with time the proposed model combines the steadystate temperature prediction in continuous machining with transient temperature evaluation in interrupted cutting operations where the chip and the process change in a discontinuous manner the mathematical models and simulation results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental temperature measurements reported in the literature a summary of methods applied to tool condition monitoring in drilling presents a summary of the monitoring methods signal analysis and diagnostic techniques for tool wear and failure monitoring in drilling that have been tested and reported in the literature the paper covers only indirect monitoring methods such as force vibration and current measurements signal analysis techniques cover all the methods that have been used with indirect measurements including eg statistical parameters and fast fourier and wavelet transform only a limited number of automatic diagnostic tools have been developed for diagnosis of the condition of the tool in drilling all of these rather diverse approaches that have been available are covered in this study only in a few of the papers have attempts been made to compare the chosen approach with other methods many of the papers only present one approach and unfortunately quite often the test material of the study is limited especially in what comes to the cutting process parameter variation and also workpiece material comparative statistical analysis of hole taper and circularity in laser percussion drilling investigates the relationships and parameter interactions between six controllable variables on the hole taper and circularity in laser percussion drilling experiments have been conducted on stainless steel workpieces and a comparison was made between stainless steel and mild steel the central composite design was employed to plan the experiments in order to achieve required information with reduced number of experiments the process performance was evaluated the ratio of minimum to maximum ferets diameter was considered as circularity characteristic of the hole the models of these three process characteristics were developed by linear multiple regression technique the significant coefficients were obtained by performing analysis of variance anova at 1 5 and 7 levels of significance the final models were checked by complete residual analysis and finally were experimentally verified it was found that the pulse frequency had a significant effect on the hole entrance diameter and hole circularity in drilling stainless steel unlike the drilling of mild steel where the pulse frequency had no significant effect on the hole characteristics networkcentric systems the

magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor openloop estimators or closedloop observers are used for this purpose they differ with respect to accuracy robustness and sensitivity against model parameter variations dynamic performance and steadystate speed accuracy in the lowspeed range can be achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine the overview in this paper uses signal flow graphs of complex space vector quantities to provide an insightful description of the systems used in sensorless control of induction motors decomposition of additive cellular automata finite additive cellular automata with fixed and periodic boundary conditions are considered as endomorphisms over pattern spaces a characterization of the nilpotent and regular parts of these endomorphisms is given in terms of their minimal polynomials generalized eigenspace decomposition is determined and relevant cyclic subspaces are described in terms of symmetries as an application the lengths and frequencies of limit cycles in the transition diagram of the automaton are calculated dynamic neighborhood structures in parallel evolution strategies parallelizing is a straightforward approach to reduce the total computation time of evolutionary algorithms finding an appropriate communication network within spatially structured populations for improving convergence speed and convergence probability is a difficult task a new method that uses a dynamic communication scheme in an evolution strategy will be compared with conventional static and dynamic approaches the communication structure is based on a socalled diffusion model approach the links between adjacent individuals are dynamically chosen according to deterministic or probabilistic rules due to selforganization effects efficient and stable communication structures are established that perform robustly and quickly on a multimodal test function optimization of the memory weighting function in stochastic functional selforganized sorting performed by a team of autonomous mobile agents the activity of a team of autonomous mobile agents formed by identical robotlikeant individuals capable of performing a random walk through an environment that are able to recognize and move different objects is modeled the emergent desired behavior is a distributed sorting and clustering based only on local information and a memory register that records the past objects encountered an optimum weighting function for the memory registers is theoretically derived the optimum timedependent weighting function allows sorting and clustering of the randomly distributed objects in the shortest time by maximizing the average speed of a texture feature the contrast we check the central assumption the intermediate steadystates hypothesis of our theoretical result it is proved that the algorithm optimization based on maximum speed variation of the contrast feature gives relationships similar to the theoretically derived annealing law evolving robust asynchronous cellular automata for the density task in this paper the evolution of three kinds of asynchronous cellular automata are studied for the density task results are compared with those obtained for synchronous automata and the influence of various asynchronous update policies on the computational strategy is described how synchronous and asynchronous cellular automata behave is investigated when the update policy is gradually changed showing that asynchronous cellular automata are more adaptable the behavior of synchronous and asynchronous evolved automata are studied under the presence of random noise of two kinds and it is shown that asynchronous cellular automata implicitly offer superior fault tolerance measuring return revealing roi the most critical part of the returnoninvestment odyssey is to develop metrics that matter to the business and to measure systems in terms of their ability to help achieve those business goals everything must flow from those key metrics and dont forget to revisit those every now and then too since all systems wind down over time its important to keep tabs on how well your automation investment is meeting the metrics established by your company manufacturers are clamoring for a tool to help quantify returns and analyze the results trading exchanges online marketplaces evolve looks at how trading exchanges are evolving rapidly to help manufacturers keep up with customer demand implementing its all about processes looks at how the key to successful technology deployment can be found in a set of four basic disciplines ethernet networks getting down to business while it seems pretty clear that ethernet has won the battle for the mindshare as the network of choice for the factory floor theres still a war to be won in implementation as cuttingedge manufacturers begin to adopt the technology on a widespread basis its time to buy there is an upside to a down economy overzealous suppliers are willing to make deals that were unthinkable a few years ago thats because vendors are experiencing the same money squeeze as manufacturers which makes the year 2002 the perfect time to invest in new technology the author states that when negotiating the deal provisions for unexpected costs an exit strategy and even shared risk with the vendor should be on the table crm approaching zenith looks at how manufacturers are starting to warm up to the concept of customer relationship management crm has matured into what is expected to be big business as crm software evolves to its second some say third generation its likely to be more valuable to holdouts in manufacturing and other sectors jpeg2000 standard for interactive imaging jpeg2000 is the latest image compression standard to emerge from the joint photographic experts group jpeg working under the auspices of the international standards organization although the new standard does offer superior compression performance to jpeg jpeg2000 provides a whole new way of interacting with compressed imagery in a scalable and interoperable fashion this paper provides a tutorialstyle review of the new standard explaining the technology on which it is based and drawing comparisons with jpeg and other compression standards the paper also describes new work exploiting the capabilities of jpeg2000 in clientserver systems for efficient interactive browsing of images over the internet buying into the relationship business software choosing the right software to improve business processes can have a huge impact on a companys efficiency and profitability while it is sometimes hard to get beyond vendor hype about software features and functionality and know what to realistically expect it is even more difficult to determine if the vendor is the right vendor to partner with thus picking the right software is important but companies have to realize that what they are really buying into is a relationship with the vendor on the monotonicity conservation in numerical solutions of the heat equation it is important to choose such numerical methods in practice that mirror the characteristic properties of the described process beyond the stability and convergence the investigated qualitative property in this paper is the conservation of the monotonicity in space of the initial heat distribution we prove some statements about the monotonicity conservation and total monotonicity of onestep vectoriterations then applying these results we consider the numerical solutions of the onedimensional heat equation our main theorem formulates the necessary and sufficient condition of the uniform monotonicity conservation the sharpness of the conditions is demonstrated by numerical examples construction of twosided bounds for initialboundary value problems this paper extends the bounding operator approach developed for boundary value problems to the case of initialboundary value problems ibvps following the general principle of bounding operators enclosing methods for the case of partial differential equations are discussed in particular continuous discretization methods with an appropriate error bound controlled shift and monotone extensions of rothes method for parabolic problems are investigated operator splitting and approximate factorization for taxisdiffusionreaction models in this paper we consider the numerical solution of 2d systems of certain types of taxisdiffusionreaction equations from mathematical biology by spatial discretization these pde systems are approximated by systems of positive nonlinear odes method of lines the aim of this paper is to examine the numerical integration of these ode systems for low to moderate accuracy by means of splitting techniques an important consideration is maintenance of positivity we apply operator splitting and approximate matrix factorization using low order explicit rungekutta methods and linearly implicit rungekuttarosenbrock methods as a reference method the general purpose solver vodpk is applied new methods for oscillatory problems based on classical codes the numerical integration of differential equations with oscillatory solutions is a very common problem in many fields of the applied sciences some methods have been specially devised for this kind of problem in most of them the calculation of the coefficients needs more computational effort than the classical codes because such coefficients depend on the stepsize in a not simple manner on the contrary in this work we present new algorithms specially designed for perturbed oscillators whose coefficients have a simple dependence on the stepsize the methods obtained are competitive when comparing with classical and special codes sharpening the estimate of the stability constant in the maximumnorm of the cranknicolson scheme for the onedimensional heat equation this paper is concerned with the stability constant csub infinity  in the maximumnorm of the cranknicolson scheme applied to the onedimensional heat equation a well known result due to sj serdyukova is that csub infinity   23 in the present paper by using a sharp resolvent estimate for the discrete laplacian together with the cauchy formula it is shown that 3 or csub infinity   4325 this bound also holds when the heat equation is considered on a bounded interval along with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions multiple shooting using a dichotomically stable integrator for solving differentialalgebraic equations in previous work by the first author it has been established that a dichotomically stable discretization is needed when solving a stiff boundaryvalue problem in ordinary differential equations odes when sharp boundary layers may occur at each end of the interval a dichotomically stable implicit rungekutta method using the 3stage fourthorder lobatto iiia formulae has been implemented in a variable stepsize initialvalue integrator which could be used in a multipleshooting approach in the case of indexone differentialalgebraic equations daes the use of the lobatto iiia formulae has an advantage over a comparable gaussian method that the order is the same for both differential and algebraic variables and there is no need to treat them separately the ode integrator has been adapted for the solution of indexone daes and the resulting integrator symdae has been inserted into the multipleshooting code mshdae previously developed by r lamour for differentialalgebraic boundaryvalue problems the standard version of mshdae uses a bdf integrator which is not dichotomically stable and for some stiff test problems this fails to integrate across the interval of interest while the dichotomically stable integrator symdae encounters no difficulty indeed for such problems the modified version of mshdae produces an accurate solution and within limits imposed by computer word length the efficiency of the solution process improves with increasing stiffness for some nonstiff problems the solution is also entirely satisfactory numerical behaviour of stable and unstable solitary waves in this paper we analyse the behaviour in time of the numerical approximations to solitary wave solutions of the generalized benjaminbonamahony equation this equation possesses an important property the stability of these solutions depends on their velocity we identify the error propagation mechanisms in both the stable and unstable case in particular we show that in the stable case numerical methods that preserve some conserved quantities of the problem are more appropriate for the simulation of this kind of solutions postprojected rungekutta methods for index2 differentialalgebraic equations a new projection technique for rungekutta methods applied to index2 differentialalgebraic equations is presented in which the numerical approximation is projected only as part of the output process it is shown that for methods that are strictly stable at infinity the order of convergence is unaffected compared to standard projected methods gauss methods for which this technique is of special interest when some symmetry is to be preserved are studied in more detail quasi stage order conditions for sdirk methods the stage order condition is a simplifying assumption that reduces the number of order conditions to be fulfilled when designing a rungekutta rk method because a dirk diagonally implicit rk method cannot have stage order greater than 1 we introduce quasi stage order conditions and derive some of their properties for dirks we use these conditions to derive a loworder dirk method with embedded error estimator numerical tests with stiff odes and daes of index 1 and 2 indicate that the method is competitive with other rk methods for low accuracy tolerances national learning systems a new approach on technological change in late industrializing economies and evidences from the cases of brazil and south korea the paper has two intertwined parts the first one is a proposal for a conceptual and theoretical framework to understand technical change in late industrializing economies the second part develops a kind of empirical test of the usefulness of that new framework by means of a comparative study of the brazilian and south korean cases all the four types of macroevidences of the technical change processes of brazil and korea corroborate directly or indirectly the hypothesis of the existence of actual cases of national learning systems nlss of passive and active nature as it is shown to be the cases of brazil and south korea respectively the contrast between the two processes of technical change prove remarkable despite both processes being essentially confined to learning the concepts of passive and active nlss show how useful they are to apprehend the diversity of those realities and consequently to avoid for instance interpretations that misleadingly suppose based on conventional economic theory that those countries have a similar lack of technological dynamism selforganized critical traffic in parallel computer networks in a recent paper we analysed the dynamics of traffic flow in a simple square lattice architecture it was shown that a phase transition takes place between a free and a congested phase the transition point was shown to exhibit optimal information transfer and wide fluctuations in time with scalefree properties in this paper we further extend our analysis by considering a generalization of the previous model in which the rate of packet emission is regulated by the local congestion perceived by each node as a result of the feedback between traffic congestion and packet release the system is poised at criticality many wellknown statistical features displayed by internet traffic are recovered from our model in a natural way from continuous recovery to discrete filtering in numerical approximations of conservation laws modern numerical approximations of conservation laws rely on numerical dissipation as a means of stabilization the older alternative approach is the use of central differencing with a dose of artificial dissipation in this paper we review the successful class of weighted essentially nonoscillatory finite volume schemes which comprise sophisticated methods of the first kind new developments in image processing have made new devices possible which can serve as highly nonlinear artificial dissipation terms we view artificial dissipation as discrete filter operation and introduce several new algorithms inspired by image processing moving into the mainstream product lifecycle management product lifecycle management plm is widely recognised by most manufacturing companies as manufacturers begin to identify and implement targeted projects intended to deliver returnon investment in a timely fashion vendors are also releasing secondgeneration plm products that are packaged outofthebox solutions more than the money software project experiences creating budgets for large software projects have taught manufacturers that it is not about the money  it is about what one really needs before a company can begin to build a budget for a software project it has to have a good understanding of what business issues need to be addressed and what the business objectives are this step is critical because it defines the business goals outlines the metrics for success sets the scope for the project and defines the criteria for selecting the right software technology decisions 2002 the paper looks at the critical hardware software and services choices manufacturers are making as they begin to emerge from the recession and position themselves for the future design and prototype of a performance tool interface for openmp this paper proposes a performance tools interface for openmp similar in spirit to the mpi profiling interface in its intent to define a clear and portable api that makes openmp execution events visible to runtime performance tools we present our design using a sourcelevel instrumentation approach based on openmp directive rewriting rules to instrument each directive and their combination are applied to generate calls to the interface consistent with directive semantics and to pass context information eg source code locations in a portable and efficient way our proposed openmp performance api further allows user functions and arbitrary code regions to be marked and performance measurement to be controlled using new openmp directives to prototype the proposed openmp performance interface we have developed compatible performance libraries for the expert automatic event trace analyzer 17 18 and the tau performance analysis framework 13 the directive instrumentation transformations we define are implemented in a sourcetosource translation tool called opari application examples are presented for both expert and tau to show the openmp performance interface and opari instrumentation tool in operation when used together with the mpi profiling interface as the examples also demonstrate our proposed approach provides a portable and robust solution to performance analysis of openmp and mixedmode openmp  mpi applications hpcview a tool for topdown analysis of node performance it is increasingly difficult for complex scientific programs to attain a significant fraction of peak performance on systems that are based on microprocessors with substantial instructionlevel parallelism and deep memory hierarchies despite this trend performance analysis and tuning tools are still not used regularly by algorithm and application designers to a large extent existing performance tools fail to meet many user needs and are cumbersome to use to address these issues we developed hpcview  a toolkit for combining multiple sets of program profile data correlating the data with source code and generating a database that can be analyzed anywhere with a commodity web browser we argue that hpcview addresses many of the issues that have limited the usability and the utility of most existing tools we originally built hpcview to facilitate our own work on data layout and optimizing compilers now in addition to daily use within our group hpcview is being used by several code development teams in dod and doe laboratories as well as at ncsa the magnet toolkit design implementation and evaluation the current trend in constructing highperformance computing systems is to connect a large number of machines via a fast interconnect or a largescale network such as the internet this approach relies on the performance of the interconnect or internet to enable fast largescale distributed computing a detailed understanding of the communication traffic is required in order to optimize the operation of the entire system network researchers traditionally monitor traffic in the network to gain the insight necessary to optimize network operations recent work suggests additional insight can be obtained by also monitoring traffic at the application level the monitor for applicationgenerated network traffic toolkit magnet we describe here monitors application traffic patterns in production systems thus enabling more highly optimized networks and interconnects for the next generation of highperformance computing systems packet spacing an enabling mechanism for delivering multimedia content in computational grids streaming multimedia with udp has become increasingly popular over distributed systems like the internet scientific applications that stream multimedia include remote computational steering of visualization data and videoondemand teleconferencing over the access grid however udp does not possess a selfregulating congestioncontrol mechanism and most besteffort traffic is served by congestioncontrolled tcp consequently udp steals bandwidth from tcp such that tcp flows starve for network resources with the volume of internet traffic continuing to increase the perpetuation of udpbased streaming will cause the internet to collapse as it did in the mid1980s due to the use of noncongestioncontrolled tcp to address this problem we introduce the counterintuitive notion of interpacket spacing with control feedback to enable udpbased applications to perform well in the nextgeneration internet and computational grids when compared with traditional udpbased streaming we illustrate that our approach can reduce packet loss over 50 without adversely affecting delivered throughput a virtual test facility for the simulation of dynamic response in materials the center for simulating dynamic response of materials at the california institute of technology is constructing a virtual shock physics facility for studying the response of various target materials to very strong shocks the virtual test facility vtf is an endtoend fully threedimensional simulation of the detonation of high explosives he shock wave propagation solid material response to pressure loading and compressible turbulence the vtf largely consists of a parallel fluid solver and a parallel solid mechanics package that are coupled together by the exchange of boundary data the eulerian fluid code and lagrangian solid mechanics model interact via a novel approach based on level sets the two main computational packages are integrated through the use of pyre a problem solving environment written in the python scripting language pyre allows application developers to interchange various computational models and solver packages without recompiling code and it provides standardized access to several data visualization engines and data input mechanisms in this paper we outline the main components of the vtf discuss their integration via pyre and describe some recent accomplishments in largescale simulation using the vtf highlevel language support for userdefined reductions the optimized handling of reductions on parallel supercomputers or clusters of workstations is critical to high performance because reductions are common in scientific codes and a potential source of bottlenecks yet in many highlevel languages a mechanism for writing efficient reductions remains surprisingly absent further when such mechanisms do exist they often do not provide the flexibility a programmer needs to achieve a desirable level of performance in this paper we present a new language construct for arbitrary reductions that lets a programmer achieve a level of performance equal to that achievable with the highly flexible but lowlevel combination of fortran and mpi we have implemented this construct in the zpl language and evaluate it in the context of the initialization of the nas mg benchmark we show a 45 times speedup over the same code written in zpl without this construct in addition performance on a large number of processors surpasses that achieved in the nas implementation showing that our mechanism provides programmers with the needed flexibility formuladependent equivalence for compositional ctl model checking we present a polytime computable state equivalence that is defined with respect to a given ctl formula since it does not attempt to preserve all ctl formulas like bisimulation does we can expect to compute coarser equivalences this equivalence can be used to reduce the complexity of model checking a system of interacting fsm additionally we show that in some cases our techniques can detect if a formula passes or fails without forming the entire product machine the method is exact and fully automatic and handles full ctl adaptive optimizing compilers for the 21st century historically compilers have operated by applying a fixed set of optimizations in a predetermined order we call such an ordered list of optimizations a compilation sequence this paper describes a prototype system that uses biased random search to discover a programspecific compilation sequence that minimizes an explicit external objective function the result is a compiler framework that adapts its behavior to the application being compiled to the pool of available transformations to the objective function and to the target machine this paper describes experiments that attempt to characterize the space that the adaptive compiler must search the preliminary results suggest that optimal solutions are rare and that local minima are frequent if this holds true biased random searches such as agenetic algorithm should find good solutions more quickly than simpler strategies such as hill climbing hybrid decision tree in this paper a hybrid learning approach named hybrid decision tree hdt is proposed hdt simulates human reasoning by using symbolic learning to do qualitative analysis and using neural learning to do subsequent quantitative analysis it generates the trunk of a binary hdt according to the binary information gain ratio criterion in an instance space defined by only original unordered attributes if unordered attributes cannot further distinguish training examples falling into a leaf node whose diversity is beyond the diversitythreshold then the node is marked as a dummy node after all those dummy nodes are marked a specific feedforward neural network named fannc that is trained in an instance space defined by only original ordered attributes is exploited to accomplish the learning task moreover this paper distinguishes three kinds of incremental learning tasks two incremental learning procedures designed for exampleincremental learning with different storage requirements are provided which enables hdt to deal gracefully with data sets where new data are frequently appended also a hypothesisdriven constructive induction mechanism is provided which enables hdt to generate compact concept descriptions tcrm diagnosing tuple inconsistency for granulized datasets many approaches to granularization have been presented for knowledge discovery however the inconsistent tuples that exist in granulized datasets are hardly ever revealed we developed a model tuple consistency recognition model tcrm to help efficiently detect inconsistent tuples for datasets that are granulized the main outputs of the developed model include explored inconsistent tuples and consumed processing time we further conducted an empirical test where eighteen continuous reallife datasets granulized by the equal width interval technique that embedded splus histogram binning algorithm shba and largest binning size algorithm lbsa binning algorithms were diagnosed remarkable results almost 40 of the granulized datasets contain inconsistent tuples and 22 have the amount of inconsistent tuples more than 20 a knowledge intensive multiagent framework for cooperativecollaborative design modeling and decision support of assemblies multiagent modeling has emerged as a promising discipline for dealing with the decision making process in distributed information system applications one of such applications is the modeling of distributed design or manufacturing processes which can link up various designs or manufacturing processes to form a virtual consortium on a global basis this paper proposes a novel knowledge intensive multiagent cooperativecollaborative framework for concurrent intelligent design and assembly planning which integrates product design design for assembly assembly planning assembly system design and assembly simulation subjected to econotechnical evaluations an ai protocol based method is proposed to facilitate the integration of intelligent agents for assembly design planning evaluation and simulation processes a unified class of knowledge intensive petri nets is defined using the oo knowledgebased petri net approach and used as an ai protocol for handling both the integration and the negotiation problems among multiagents the detailed cooperativecollaborative mechanism and algorithms are given based on the knowledge object cooperation formalisms as such the assemblyoriented design system can easily be implemented under the multiagentbased knowledgeintensive petri net framework with concurrent integration of multiple cooperative knowledge sources and software thus product design and assembly planning can be carried out simultaneously and intelligently in an entirely computeraided concurrent design and assembly planning system multiagent collaboration for b2b workflow monitoring businesstobusiness b2b application environments are exceedingly dynamic and competitive this dynamism is manifested in the form of changing process requirements and time constraints however current workflow management technologies have difficulties trying to solve problems such as how to deal with the dynamic nature of b2b commerce processes how to manage the distributed knowledge and recourses and how to reduce the transaction risk in this paper a collaborative multiagent system is proposed multiple intelligent agents in our system can work together not only to identify the workflow problems but also to solve such problems by applying business rules such as reorganizing the procurement and the transaction processes and making necessary workflow process changes a knowledgebased approach for business process reengineering shamash we present an overview of shamash a process modelling tool for business process reengineering the main features that differentiate it from most current related tools are its ability to define and use organisation standards functional structure and develop automatic model simulation and optimisation shamash is a knowledgebased system and we include a discussion on how knowledge acquisition takes place furthermore we introduce a high level description of the architecture the conceptual model and other important modules of the system knowledge flow management for distributed team software development cognitive cooperation is often neglected in current team software development processes this issue becomes more important than ever when team members are globally distributed this paper presents a notion of knowledge flow and the related management mechanism for realizing an ordered knowledge sharing and cognitive cooperation in a geographically distributed team software development process the knowledge flow can carry and accumulate knowledge when it goes through from one team member to another the coordination between the knowledge flow process and the workflow process of a development team provides a new way to improve traditional team software development processes a knowledge grid platform has been implemented to support the knowledge flow management across the internet a knowledgebased approach for managing urban infrastructures this paper presents a knowledge ebased approach dedicated to the efficient management regulation interactive and dynamic monitoring of urban infrastructures this approach identifies the data and related treatments common to several municipal activities and defines the requirements and functionalities of the computer tools developed to improve the delivery and coordination of municipal services to the population the resulting cooperative system called sigiu is composed of a set of integrated operating systems sydex and the global planning and coordination system sygec the objective is to integrate the set of sydex and the sygec into a single coherent system for all the sigius users according to their tasks their roles and their responsibilities within the municipal administration sigiu is provided by different measurement and monitoring instruments installed on some systems elements to be supervised in this context the information can be presented in different forms video pictures data and alarms one of sigius objectives is the realtime management of urban infrastructures control mechanisms to carry out this process the alarm control agent creates a mobile agent associated with the alarm which is sent to a mobile station and warns an operator preliminary implementation results show that sigiu supports effectively and efficiently the decision making process related to managing urban infrastructures knowledge acquisition for expert systems in accounting and financial problem domains since the mid1980s expert systems have been developed for a variety of problems in accounting and finance the most commonly cited problems in developing these systems are the unavailability of the experts and knowledge engineers and difficulties with the rule extraction process within the field of artificial intelligence this has been called the knowledge acquisition ka problem and has been identified as a major bottleneck in the expert system development process recent empirical research reveals that certain ka techniques are significantly more efficient than others in helping to extract certain types of knowledge within specific problem domains this paper presents a mapping between these empirical studies and a generic taxonomy of expert system problem domains to accomplish this we first examine the range of problem domains and suggest a mapping of accounting and finance tasks to a generic problem domain taxonomy we then identify and describe the most prominent ka techniques employed in developing expert systems in accounting and finance after examining and summarizing the existing empirical ka work we conclude by showing how the empirical ka research in the various problem domains can be used to provide guidance to developers of expert systems in the fields of accounting and finance knowledge organisation of product design blackboard systems via graph decomposition knowledge organisation plays an important role in building a knowledgebased product design blackboard system wellorganised knowledge sources will facilitate the effectiveness and efficiency of communication and data exchange in a blackboard system in a previous investigation an approach for constructing blackboard systems for product design using a nondirected graph decomposition algorithm was proposed in this paper the relationship between graph decomposition and the resultant blackboard system is further studied a case study of a number of hypothetical blackboard systems that comprise different knowledge organisations is provided a formal framework for viewpoint consistency multiple viewpoint models of system development are becoming increasingly important each viewpoint offers a different perspective on the target system and system development involves parallel refinement of the multiple views viewpoint related approaches have been considered in a number of different guises by a spectrum of researchers our work particularly focuses on the use of viewpoints in open distributed processing odp which is an isoitu standardisation framework the requirements of viewpoint modelling in odp are very broad and hence demanding multiple viewpoints though prompt the issue of consistency between viewpoints this paper describes a very general interpretation of consistency which we argue is broad enough to meet the requirements of consistency in odp we present a formal framework for this general interpretation highlight basic properties of the interpretation and locate restricted classes of consistency strategies for checking consistency are also investigated throughout we illustrate our theory using the formal description technique lotos thus the paper also characterises the nature of and options for consistency checking in lotos modeling discourse in collaborative work support systems a knowledge representation and configuration perspective collaborative work processes usually raise a lot of intricate debates and negotiations among participants whereas conflicts of interest are inevitable and support for achieving consensus and compromise is required individual contributions brought up by parties with different backgrounds and interests need to be appropriately structured and maintained this paper presents a model of discourse acts that participants use to communicate their attitudes to each other or affect the attitudes of others in such environments the first part deals with the knowledge representation and communication aspects of the problem while the second one in the context of an already implemented system namely hermes with issues related to the configuration of the contributions asserted at each discourse instance the overall work focuses on the machinery needed in a computerassisted collaborative work environment the aim being to further enhance the humancomputer interaction an approach to developing computational supports for reciprocal tutoring this study presents a novel approach to developing computational supports for reciprocal tutoring reciprocal tutoring is a collaborative learning activity where two participants take turns to play the role of a tutor and a tutee the computational supports include scaffolding tools for the tutor and a computersimulated virtual participant the approach including system architecture implementations of scaffolding tools for the tutor and of a virtual participant is presented herein furthermore a system for reciprocal tutoring is implemented as an example of the approach mining the optimal class association rule set we define an optimal class association rule set to be the minimum rule set with the same predictive power of the complete class association rule set using this rule set instead of the complete class association rule set we can avoid redundant computation that would otherwise be required for mining predictive association rules and hence improve the efficiency of the mining process significantly we present an efficient algorithm for mining the optimal class association rule set using an upward closure property of pruning weak rules before they are actually generated we have implemented the algorithm and our experimental results show that our algorithm generates the optimal class association rule set whose size is smaller than 117 of the complete class association rule set on average in significantly less time than generating the complete class association rule set our proposed criterion has been shown very effective for pruning weak rules in dense databases formalising optimal feature weight setting in case based diagnosis as linear programming problems many approaches to case based reasoning cbr exploit feature weight setting algorithms to reduce the sensitivity to distance functions we demonstrate that optimal feature weight setting in a special kind of cbr problems can be formalised as linear programming problems therefore the optimal weight settings can be calculated in polynomial time instead of searching in exponential weight space using heuristics to get suboptimal settings we also demonstrate that our approach can be used to solve classification problems formalization of weighted factors analysis weighted factors analysis wefa has been proposed as a new approach for elicitation representation and manipulation of knowledge about a given problem generally at a high and strategic level central to this proposal is that a group of experts in the area of the problem can identify a hierarchy of factors with positive or negative influences on the problem outcome the tangible output of wefa is a directed weighted graph called a wefa graph this is a set of nodes denoting factors that can directly or indirectly influence an overall aim of the graph the aim is also represented by a node each directed arc is a direct influence of one factor on another a chain of directed arcs indicates an indirect influence the influences may be identified as either positive or negative for example sales and costs are two factors that influence the aim of profitability in an organization sales has a positive influence on profitability and costs has a negative influence on profitability in addition the relative significance of each influence is represented by a weight we develop binary wefa which is a variant of wefa where the factors in the graph are restricted to being either true or false imposing this restriction on a wefa graph allows us to be more precise about the meaning of the graph and of reasoning in it binary wefa is a new proposal that provides a formal yet sufficiently simple language for logicbased argumentation for use by business people in decisionsupport and knowledge management whilst binary wefa is expressively simpler than other logicbased argumentation formalisms it does incorporate a novel formalization of

approach for fir models the identification of stochastic discrete systems disturbed with noise is discussed in this brief the concept of general prediction error gpe criterion is introduced for the timedomain estimate with optimal frequency estimation ofe introduced for the frequencydomain estimate the two estimation methods are combined to form a new identification algorithm which is called the empirical frequencydomain optimal parameter efop estimate for the finite impulse response fir model interfered by noise the algorithm theoretically provides the global optimum of the model

failover protection for important windowsbased applications its solution was to implement a powerful failover server from uk supplier neverfail in order to provide realtime backup for three core production servers efficient parallel programming on scalable shared memory systems with high performance fortran openmp offers a highlevel interface for parallel programming on scalable shared memory smp architectures it provides the user with simple worksharing directives while it relies on the compiler to generate parallel programs based on thread parallelism however the lack of language features for exploiting data locality often results in poor performance since the nonuniform memory access times on scalable smp machines cannot be neglected high performance fortran hpf the defacto standard for data parallel programming offers a rich set of data distribution directives in order to exploit data locality but it has been mainly targeted towards distributed memory machines in this paper we describe an optimized execution model for hpf programs on smp machines that avails itself with mechanisms provided by openmp for work sharing and thread parallelism while exploiting data locality based on userspecified distribution directives data locality does not only ensure that most memory accesses are close to the executing threads and are therefore faster but it also minimizes synchronization overheads especially in the case of unstructured reductions the proposed shared memory execution model for hpf relies on a small set of language extensions which resemble the openmp worksharing features these extensions together with an optimized shared memory parallelization and execution model have been implemented in the adaptor hpf compilation system and experimental results verify the efficiency of the chosen approach techniques for compiling and implementing all nas parallel benchmarks in hpf the nas parallel benchmarks npb are a wellknown benchmark set for highperformance machines much effort has been made to implement them in highperformance fortran hpf in previous attempts however the hpf versions did not include the complete set of benchmarks and the performance was not always good in this study we implement all eight benchmarks of the npb in hpf and parallelize them using an hpf compiler that we have developed this report describes the implementation techniques and compiler features necessary to achieve good performance we evaluate the hpf version on the hitachi sr2201 a distributedmemory parallel machine with 16 processors the execution time of the hpf version is within a factor of 15 of the handparallelized version of the npb 23 beta advanced optimization strategies in the rice dhpf compiler highperformance fortran hpf was envisioned as a vehicle for modernizing legacy fortran codes to achieve scalable parallel performance to a large extent todays commercially available hpf compilers have failed to deliver scalable parallel performance for a broad spectrum of applications because of insufficiently powerful compiler analysis and optimization substantial restructuring and handoptimization can be required to achieve acceptable performance with an hpf port of an existing fortran application even for regular dataparallel applications a key goal of the rice dhpf compiler project has been to develop optimization techniques that enable a wide range of existing scientific applications to be ported easily to efficient hpf with minimal restructuring this paper describes the challenges to effective parallelization presented by complex but regular dataparallel applications and then describes how the novel analysis and optimization technologies in the dhpf compiler address these challenges effectively without major rewriting of the applications we illustrate the techniques by describing their use for parallelizing the nas sp and bt benchmarks the dhpf compiler generates multipartitioned parallelizations of these codes that are approaching the scalability and efficiency of sophisticated handcoded parallelizations achieving performance under openmp on ccnuma and software distributed shared memory systems openmp is emerging as a viable highlevel programming model for shared memory parallel systems it was conceived to enable easy portable application development on this range of systems and it has also been implemented on cachecoherent nonuniform memory access ccnuma architectures unfortunately it is hard to obtain high performance on the latter architecture particularly when large numbers of threads are involved in this paper we discuss the difficulties faced when writing openmp programs for ccnuma systems and explain how the vendors have attempted to overcome them we focus on one such system the sgi origin 2000 and perform a variety of experiments designed to illustrate the impact of the vendors efforts we compare codes written in a standard looplevel parallel style under openmp with alternative versions written in a single program multiple data spmd fashion also realized via openmp and show that the latter consistently provides superior performance a carefully chosen set of language extensions can help us translate programs from the former style to the latter or to compile directly but in a similar manner syntax for these extensions can be borrowed from hpf and some aspects of hpf compiler technology can help the translation process it is our expectation that an extended language if well compiled would improve the attractiveness of openmp as a language for highperformance computation on an important class of modern architectures finding performance bugs with the tno hpf benchmark suite highperformance fortran hpf has been designed to provide portable performance on distributed memory machines an important aspect of portable performance is the behavior of the available hpf compilers ideally a programmer may expect comparable performance between different hpf compilers given the same program and the same machine to test the performance portability between compilers we have designed a special benchmark suite called the tno hpf benchmark suite it consists of a set of hpf programs that test various aspects of efficient parallel code generation the benchmark suite consists of a number of template programs that are used to generate test programs with different array sizes alignments distributions and iteration spaces it ranges from very simple assignments to more complex assignments such as triangular iteration spaces convex iteration spaces coupled subscripts and indirection arrays we have run the tno hpf benchmark suite on three compilers the prepare prototype compiler the pgihpf compiler and the gmd adaptor hpf compiler results show performance differences that can be quite large up to two orders of magnitude for the same test program closer inspection reveals that the origin of most of the differences in performance is due to differences in local enumeration and storage of distributed array elements compatibility comparison and performance evaluation for japanese hpf compilers using scientific applications the lack of compatibility of highperformance fortran hpf between vender implementations has been disheartening scientific application users so as to hinder the development of portable programs thus parallel computing is still unpopular in the computational science community even though parallel programming is common to the computer science community as users would like to run the same source code on parallel machines with different architectures as fast as possible we have investigated the compatibility of source codes for japanese hpf compilers nec fujitsu and hitachi with two realworld applications a 3d fluid code and a 2d particle code we have found that the sourcelevel compatibility between japanese hpf compilers is almost preserved but more effort will be needed to sustain complete compatibility we have also evaluated parallel performance and found that hpf can achieve good performance for the 3d fluid code with almost the same source code for the 2d particle code good results have also been obtained with a small number of processors but some changes in the original source code and the addition of interface blocks is required highperformance numerical pricing methods the pricing of financial derivatives is an important field in finance and constitutes a major component of financial management applications the uncertainty of future events often makes analytic approaches infeasible and hence timeconsuming numerical simulations are required in the aurora financial management system pricing is performed on the basis of lattice representations of stochastic multidimensional scenario processes using the monte carlo simulation and backward induction methods the latter allowing for the exploitation of sharedmemory parallelism we present the parallelization of a backward induction numerical pricing kernel on a cluster of smps using hpf an extended version of highperformance fortran based on language extensions for specifying a hierarchical mapping of data onto an smp cluster the compiler generates a hybridparallel program combining distributedmemory and sharedmemory parallelism we outline the parallelization strategy adopted by the vfc compiler and present an experimental evaluation of the pricing kernel on an nec sx5 vector supercomputer and a linux smp cluster comparing a pure mpi version to a hybridparallel mpiopenmp version optimization of elementbyelement fem in hpf 11 in this study poissons equation is numerically evaluated by the elementbyelement ebe finiteelement method in a parallel environment using hpf 11 highperformance fortran in order to achieve high parallel efficiency the data structures have been altered to nodebased data instead of mixtures of node and elementbased data representing a nodebased ebe finiteelement scheme nebe the parallel machine used in this study was the nec sx4 and experiments were performed on a single node having 32 processors sharing common memory the hpf compiler used in the experiments is hpfsx rev 20 released in 1997 unofficial which supports hpf 11 models containing approximately 200 000 and 1500000 degrees of freedom were analyzed in order to evaluate the method the calculation time parallel efficiency and memory used were compared the performance of hpf in the conjugate gradient solver for the large model using the nec sx4 compiler optionnoshrunk was about 85 that of the message passing interface threedimensional global mhd simulation code for the earths magnetosphere using hpfja we have translated a threedimensional magnetohydrodynamic mhd simulation code of the earths magnetosphere from vpp fortran to hpfja on the fujitsu vpp500056 vectorparallel supercomputer and the mhd code was fully vectorized and fully parallelized in vpp fortran the entire performance and capability of the hpf mhd code could be shown to be almost comparable to that of vpp fortran a threedimensional global mhd simulation of the earths magnetosphere was performed at a speed of over 400 gflops with an efficiency of 765 using 56 processing elements of the fujitsu vpp500056 in vector and parallel computation that permitted comparison with catalog values we have concluded that fluid and mhd codes that are fully vectorized and fully parallelized in vpp fortran can be translated with relative ease to hpfja and a code in hpfja may be expected to perform comparably to the same code written in vpp fortran highspeed cmos circuits with parallel dynamic logic and speedenhanced skewed static logic in this paper we describe parallel dynamic logic pdl which exhibits high speed without charge sharing problem pdl uses only parallelconnected transistors for fast logic evaluation and is a good candidate for highspeed lowvoltage operation it has less backbias effect compared to other logic styles which use stacked transistors furthermore pdl needs no signal ordering or tapering pdl with speedenhanced skewed static logic renders straightforward logic synthesis without the usual area penalty due to logic duplication our experimental results on two 32bit carry lookahead adders using 025 mu m cmos technology show that pdl with speedenhanced skewed static sss look reduces the delay over clockdelayedcddomino by 1527 and the powerdelay product by 2037 implementation and evaluation of hpfsx v2 we are developing hpfsx v2 a high performance fortran hpf compiler for vector parallel machines it provides some unique extensions as well as the features of hpf 20 and hpfja in particular this paper describes four of them 1 the on directive of hpf 20 2 the reflect and local directives of hpfja 3 vectorization directives and 4 automatic parallelization we evaluate these features through some benchmark programs on nec sx5 the results show that each of them achieved a 58 times speedup in 8cpu parallel execution and the four features are useful for vector parallel execution we also evaluate the overall performance of hpfsx v2 by using over 30 wellknown benchmark programs from hpfbench apr benchmarks genesis benchmarks and nas parallel benchmarks about half of the programs showed good performance while the other half suggest weakness of the compiler especially on its runtimes it is necessary to improve them to put the compiler to practical use code generator for the hpf library and fortran 95 transformational functions one of the language features of the core language of hpf 20 high performance fortran is the hpf library the hpf library consists of 55 generic functions the implementation of this library presents the challenge that all data types data kinds array ranks and input distributions need to be supported for instance more than 2 billion separate functions are required to support copyscatter fully the efficient support of these billions of specific functions is one of the outstanding problems of hpf we have solved this problem by developing a library generator which utilizes the mechanism of parameterized templates this mechanism allows the procedures to be instantiated at compile time for arguments with a specific type kind rank and distribution over a specific processor array we describe the algorithms used in the different library functions the implementation gives the ease of generating a large number of library routines from a single template the templates can be extended with special code for specific combinations of the input arguments we describe in detail the implementation and performance of the matrix multiplication template for the fujitsu vpp5000 platform vpp fortran and the design of hpfja extensions vpp fortran is a data parallel language that has been designed for the vpp series of supercomputers in addition to pure data parallelism it contains certain lowlevel features that were designed to extract high performance from user programs a comparison of vpp fortran and highperformance fortran hpf 20 shows that these lowlevel features are not available in hpf 20 the features include asynchronous interprocessor communication explicit shadow and the local directive they were shown in vpp fortran to be very useful in handling realworld applications and they have been included in the hpfja extensions they are described in the paper the hpfja language specification version 10 is an extension of hpf 20 to achieve practical performance for realworld applications and is a result of collaboration in the japan association for hpf jahpf some practical programming and tuning procedures with the hpfja language specification are described using the nas parallel benchmark bt as an example hpfja extensions of high performance fortran for accelerating realworld applications this paper presents a set of extensions on high performance fortran hpf to make it more usable for parallelizing realworld production codes hpf has been effective for programs that a compiler can automatically optimize efficiently however once the compiler cannot there have been no ways for the users to explicitly parallelize or optimize their programs in order to resolve the situation we have developed a set of hpf extensions hpfja to give the users more control over sophisticated parallelization and communication optimizations they include parallelization of loops with complicated reductions asynchronous communication usercontrollable shadow and communication pattern reuse for irregular remote data accesses preliminary experiments have proved that the extensions are effective at increasing hpfs usability applied ethics in business information units the primary thesis of this paper is that business information professionals commonly overlook ethical dilemmas in the workplace although the thesis remains unproven the author highlights by way of real and hypothetical case studies a number of situations in which ethical tensions can be identified and suggests that information professionals need to be more aware of the moral context of their actions resolving ethical dilemmas should be one of the aims of competent information professionals and their managers although it is recognized that dilemmas often cannot easily be resolved a background to the main theories of applied ethics forms the framework for later discussion a brief guide to competitive intelligence how to gather and use information on competitors the author outlines the processes involved in competitive intelligence and discusses what it is how to do it and gives examples of what happens when companies fail to monitor their competitive environment effectively the author presents a case study showing how the company that produced the precursor to the barbie doll failed to look at their business environment and how this led to the firms failure the author discusses what competitive intelligence is and what it is not and why it is important for businesses and presents three models used to describe the competitive intelligence process going through the various steps involved in defining intelligence requirements and collecting analyzing communicating and utilizing competitive intelligence why information departments are becoming academic this article outlines the increasing convergence between academia and business over the last decade or so and the mutual benefits that this closer association has brought it also looks at the growing importance of the information profession suggesting that this is leading to a greater need for specialist skills as reflected by the rise in academic courses in this area however it argues that increasing specialization must not lead to insularity if information professionals are truly concerned with gaining a competitive advantage they must not close their minds to the potential benefits of working with external non specialist partners the benefits that business has reaped from academia it is contended suggest that this may also be a fruitful avenue for information departments to explore the changing landscape for multi access portals discusses the factors that have made life difficult for consumer portal operators in recent years causing them like others in the telecommunications media and technology sector to take a close look at their business models following the dotcom crash and the consequent reassessment of internetrelated project financing by the venture capital community while the pressure is on to generate income from existing customers and users portal operators must reach new markets and find realistic revenue streams this search for real revenues has led to a move towards charging for content a strategy being pursued by a large number of horizontal portal players including msn and terra lycos this trend is particularly noticeable in china where chinadotcom operates a mainland portal and plans a range of feebased services including electronic mail the nature of advertising itself is changing with portals seeking bluechip sponsorship and marketing deals that span a number of years players are struggling to redefine and reinvent themselves as a result of the changing environment and even the term portal is believed to be obsolete partly due to its dotcom crash associations multiaccess portals are expected to dominate the consumer sector becoming bigger and better overall than their predecessors and playing a more powerful role in the consumer environment public business libraries the next chapter traces the history of the provision of business information by leeds public libraries uk from the opening of the public commercial and technical library in 1918 to the revolutionary impact of the internet in the 1990s describes how the library came to terms with the need to integrate the internet into its mainstream business information services with particular reference to its limitations and to the provision of company information market research british standards information press cuttings and articles from specialized trade and scientific journals and patents information focuses on some of the reasons why the public business library is still needed as a service to businesses even after the introduction of the internet and considers the librarys changing role and the need to impress on all concerned especially government the continuing value of these services looks to the partnerships formed by the library over the years and the ways in which these are expected to assist in realizing future opportunities in particular the fact that all public libraries in england gained free internet access at the end of 2001 offers some useful ideas about how the library could develop noting that sinto a sheffield based information network formed in 1938 and originally a partnership between the public library the two sheffield universities and various leading steel companies of the time is being examined as a model for future services in leeds concludes that the way forward can be defined in terms of five actions redefinition of priorities marketing budgets resources and the use of information technology it aggregators versus disintermediators battling it out in the information superhighstreet perhaps the future of largescale content aggregators is now no longer in doubt but this was not the case 10 years ago when many leading industry experts were much more pessimistic in their predictions in the year that dialog celebrates its thirtieth anniversary as the worlds oldest and largest professional online information service it is appropriate to look back at these changing perceptions the reasons for these changes and why the experts got it wrong we also look at the present day the value that largescale content aggregators bring to the information supply chain and we discuss why users would choose to use aggregators as opposed to going directly to the publishers a fast implementation of correlation of long data sequences for coherent receivers coherent reception depends upon matching of phase between the transmitted and received signal fast convolution techniques based on fast fourier transform fft are widely used for extracting time delay information from such matching the latency in processing a large data window of the received signal is a serious overhead for mission critical real time applications the implementation of a parallel algorithm for correlation of long data sequences in multiprocessor environment is demonstrated here the algorithm does processing while acquiring the received signal and reduces the computation overhead considerably because of inherent parallelism the impact and implementation of xml on businesstobusiness commerce this paper discusses the impact

software that helps a company manage its important business functions it should be versatile enough to automate every aspect of business processes including ebusiness an agentoriented and serviceoriented environment for deploying dynamic distributed systems this paper presents jase a javabased agentoriented and serviceoriented environment for deploying dynamic distributed systems jase utilizes two important concepts in the field of distributed computing the concept of services and remote programming with mobile agents in jase mobile agents are used to support applications and service interface agents are used to wrap services service interface agents can dynamically register their services in service server mobile agent locates a specific service interface agent by submitting requests to the service server with descriptions of required services jase uses xml to describe both service descriptions and the mobile agents queries jase supports two kinds of communication facility tuple space and asynchronous messages in this paper the design and implementation of jase are described an application shows the suitability and the effectiveness of the jase and performance evaluation is also made finally related work and some conclusions are given application of xml for neural network exchange this article introduces a framework for the interchange of trained neural network models an xmlbased language neural network markup language for the neural network model description is offered it allows to write down all the components of neural network model which are necessary for its reproduction we propose to use xml notation for the full description of neural models including data dictionary properties of training sample preprocessing methods details of network structure and parameters and methods for network output interpretation supporting unified interface to wrapper generator in integrated information retrieval given the everincreasing scale and diversity of information and applications on the internet improving the technology of information retrieval is an urgent research objective retrieved information is either semistructured or unstructured in format and its sources are extremely heterogeneous in consequence the task of efficiently gathering and extracting information from documents can be both difficult and tedious given this variety of sources and formats many choose to use mediatorwrapper architecture but its use demands a fast means of generating efficient wrappers in this paper we present a design for an automatic extensible markup language xmlbased framework with which to generate wrappers rapidly wrappers created with this framework support a unified interface for a metasearch information retrieval system based on the internet search service using the common object request broker architecture corba standard greatly advantaged by the compatibility of corba and xml a user can quickly and easily develop informationgathering applications such as a metasearch engine or any other information source retrieval method the two main things our design provides are a method of wrapper generation that is fast simple and efficient and a wrapper generator that is corba and xmlcompliant and that supports a unified interface succession in standardization grafting xml onto sgml succession in standardization is often a problem the advantages of improvements must be weighed against those of compatibility if compatibility considerations dominate a grafting process takes place according to our taxonomy of succession there are three types of outcomes a type i succession where grafting is successful entails compatibility between successors technical paradigm compliance and continuity in the standards trajectory in this paper we examine issues of succession and focus on the extensible markup language xml it was to be grafted on the standard generalized markup language sgml a stable standard since 1988 however xml was a profile a subset and an extension of sgml 1988 adaptation of sgml was needed sgml 1999 to forge full downward compatibility with xml 1998 we describe the grafting efforts and analyze their outcomes our conclusion is that although sgml was a technical exemplar for xml developers full compatibility was not achieved the widespread use of hypertext markup language html exemplified the desirability of simplicity in xml standardization this and htmls user market largely explain the discontinuity in sgmlxml succession highspeed consistency checking for hypothetical reasoning systems using inference path network hypothetical reasoning is popular in fault diagnostics and design systems but slow reasoning speed is its drawback the goal of the current study is developing hypothetical reasoning based on an inference path network which would overcome this drawback in hypothetical reasoning systems based on an inference path network there is much room for improvement regarding the computing costs of connotation processing and consistency checking the authors of this study demonstrate improvement ideas regarding one of these problems namely consistency checking first the authors obtained necessary and sufficient conditions under which inconsistencies occur during hypothesis composition based on the obtained results the authors proposed an algorithm for speeding up the process of consistency checking processing with this algorithm in its core consists of transforming the inference path network in such a way that inconsistencies do not occur during the hypothesis composition under the condition of unchanged solution hypotheses the efficiency of this algorithm was confirmed by tests definition of a similarity measure between cases based on autocrossfuzzy thesauri a similarity measure between cases is needed in order to evaluate the degree of similarity when using past similar cases in order to resolve current problems in similar case retrieval multiple indices are set up in order to characterize the queries and individual cases then terms are given as values to each the similarity measure between cases commonly used is defined using the rate at which the values provided from the corresponding indices match in practice however values cannot be expected to be mutually exclusive as a result a natural expansion of this approach is to have relationships in which mutually similar meanings are reflected in the similarity measure between cases in this paper the authors consider an autofuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between corresponding indices and a crossfuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between mutually distinct indices then defines a similarity measure between cases which considers the relationship of index values based on these thesauri this definition satisfies the characteristics required for the operation of casebased retrieval even when one value is not necessarily given in the index finally using a test similar case retrieval system the authors perform a comparative analysis of the proposed similarity measure between cases and a conventional approach implementation and performance evaluation of a fifo queue class library for time warp the authors describe the implementation use and performance evaluation of a fifo queue class library by means of a highperformance easytouse interface employed for queuing simulations in parallel discrete simulations based on the time warp method various generalpurpose simulation libraries and languages have been proposed and among these some have the advantage of not requiring users to define anything other than the state vector and not needing awareness of rollback under a platform which performs state control based on copies however because the state vectors must be defined as simple data structures without pointers dynamic data structures such as a fifo queue cannot be handled directly under the proposed class library both the platform and the user can handle such structures in the same fashion that embedded data structures are handled in addition instead of all stored data just the operational history can be stored and recovered efficiently at an effectively minimal cost by taking advantage of the firstinfirstout characteristics of the above data structures when the kernel deletes past state histories during a simulation garbage collection is also performed transparently using the corresponding method a mechanism for inferring approximate solutions under incomplete knowledge based on rule similarity this paper proposes an inference method which can obtain an approximate solution even if the knowledge stored in the problemsolving system is incomplete when a rule needed for solving the problem does not exist the problem can be solved by using rules similar to the existing rules in an implementation using the sld procedure a resolution is executed between a subgoal and a rule if an atom of the subgoal is similar to the consequence atom of the rule similarities between atoms are calculated using a knowledge base of words with account of the reasoning situation and the reliability of the derived solution is calculated based on these similarities if many solutions are obtained they are grouped into classes of similar solutions and a representative solution is then selected for each class the proposed method was verified experimentally by solving simple problems a new architecture for implementing pipelined fir adf based on classification of coefficients in this paper we propose a new method for implementing pipelined finiteimpulse response fir adaptive digital filter adf with an aim of reducing the maximum delay of the filtering portion of conventional delayed least mean square dlms pipelined adf we achieve a filtering section with a maximum delay of one by simplifying a preupsampled and a postdownsampled fir filter using the concept of classification of coefficients this reduction is independent of the order of the filter which is an advantage when the order of the filter is very large and as a result the method can also be applied to infinite impulse response iir filters furthermore when the proposed method is compared with the transpose adf which has a filtering section with zero delay it is realized that it significantly reduces the maximum delay associated with updating the coefficients of fir adf the effect of this is that the proposed method exhibits a higher convergence speed in comparison to the transpose fir adf a dataflow computer which accelerates execution of sequential programs by precedent firing instructions in the dataflow machine it is important to avoid degradation of performance in sequential processing and it is important from the viewpoint of hardware scale to reduce the number of waiting operands this paper demonstrates that processing performance is degraded by sequential processing in the switching process and presents a method of remedy precedent firing control is proposed as a means of remedy and it is shown by a simulation that the execution time and the total number of waiting operands can be reduced by the precedent firing control then the hardware scale is examined as an evaluation of precedent firing control topologyadaptive modeling of objects using surface evolutions based on 3d mathematical morphology level set methods were proposed mainly by mathematicians for constructing a model of a 3d object of arbitrary topology however those methods are computationally inefficient due to repeated distance transformations and increased dimensions in the paper we propose a new method of modeling fast objects of arbitrary topology by using a surface evolution approach based on mathematical morphology given sensor data covering the whole object surface the method begins with an initial approximation of the object by evolving a closed surface into a model topologically equivalent to the real object the refined approximation is then performed using energy minimization the method has been applied in several experiments using range data and the results are reported in the paper the development and evaluation of shoke2000 the pcibased fpga card this paper describes a pcibased fpga card shoke2000 which was developed in order to study reconfigurable computing since the latest field programmable gate arrays fpga consist of inputoutput io configurable blocks as well as internal configurable logic blocks they not only realize various user logic circuits but also connect with popular io standards easily these features enable fpga to connect several devices with different interfaces and thus new reconfigurable systems would be realizable by connecting the fpga with devices such as digital signal processors dsp and analog devices this paper describes the basic functions of shoke2000 which was developed for realizing hybrid reconfigurable systems consisting of fpga dsp and analog devices we also present application examples of shoke2000 including a simple image recognition application a distributed shared memory computer cluster and teaching materials for computer education super high definition image whd widedouble hd transmission system this paper describes a whd image transmission system constructed from a display projector codecs and a camera system imaging a super high definition image whd widedouble hd corresponding to two screen portions of common highvision images this system was developed as a transmission system to communicate with or transmit information giving a realityenhanced feeling to a remote location by using images of super high definition in addition the correction processing for the distortions of images occurring due to the structure of the camera system an outline of the transmission experiments using the proposed system and subjective evaluation experiments using whd images are presented estimation of the vanishing point for automatic driving system using a cross ratio this paper proposes a new method to estimate the vanishing point used as the vehicle heading which is essential in automatic driving systems the proposed method uses a cross ratio comprised of a ratio of lengths from four collinear points for extracting the edges that shape the vanishing point then lines that intersect at one point are fitted to the edges in a hough space consequently the vanishing point is estimated robustly even when the lane markings are occluded by other vehicles in the presence of lane markings the road boundaries are also estimated at the same time experimental results from images of a real road scene show the effectiveness of the proposed method optimization of requantization parameter for mpeg transcoding this paper considers transcoding in which an mpeg stream is converted to a lowbitrate mpeg stream and proposes a method in which the transcoding error can be reduced by optimally selecting the quantization parameter for each macroblock in transcoding with a low compression ratio it is crucial to prohibit transcoding with a requantization parameter which is 1 to 2 times the quantization parameter of the input stream consequently as the first step an optimization method for the requantization parameter is proposed which cares for the error propagation effect by interframe prediction then the proposed optimization method is extended so that the method can also be applied to the case of a high compression ratio in which the ratedistortion curve is approximated for each macroblock in the range of requantization parameters larger than 2 times the quantization parameter it is verified by a simulation experiment that the psnr is improved by 05 to 08 db compared to the case in which a 6 mbits mpeg stream is not optimized by twofold recompression an intelligent information gathering method for dynamic information mediators the internet is spreading into our society rapidly and is becoming one of the information infrastructures that are indispensable for our daily life in particular the www is widely used for various purposes such as sharing personal information academic research business work and electronic commerce and the amount of available information is increasing rapidly we usually utilize information sources on the internet as individual standalone sources but if we can integrate them we can add more value to each of them hence information mediators which integrate information distributed on the internet are drawing attention in this paper under the assumption that the information sources to be integrated are updated frequently and asynchronously we propose an information gathering method that constructs an answer to a query from a user accessing information sources to be integrated properly within an allowable time period the proposed method considers the reliability of data in the cache and the quality of answer in order to efficiently access information sources and to provide appropriate answers to the user as evaluation we show the effectiveness of the proposed method by using an artificial information integration problem in which some parameters can be modified and a realworld flight information service compared with a conventional fifo information gathering method 3d reconstruction from uncalibratedcamera optical flow and its reliability evaluation we present a scheme for reconstructing a 3d structure from optical flow observed by a camera with an unknown focal length in a statistically optimal way as well as evaluating the reliability of the computed shape first the flow fundamental matrices are optimally computed from the observed flow they are then decomposed into the focal length its rate of change and the motion parameters next the flow is optimally corrected so that it satisfies the epipolar equation exactly finally the 3d positions are computed and their covariance matrices are evaluated by simulations and realimage experiments we test the performance of our system and observe how the normalization gauge for removing indeterminacy affects the description of uncertainty reachability in contextual nets contextual nets or petri nets with read arcs are models of concurrent systems with context dependent actions the problem of reachability in such nets consists in finding a sequence of transitions that leads from the initial marking of a given contextual net to a given goal marking the solution to this problem that is presented in this paper consists in constructing a finite complete prefix of the unfolding of the given contextual net that is a finite prefix in which all the markings that are reachable from the initial marking are present and in searching in each branch of this prefix for the goal marking by solving an appropriate linear programming problem minimizing the number of successor states in the stubborn set method combinatorial explosion which occurs in parallel compositions of ltss can be alleviated by letting the stubborn set method construct onthefly a reduced lts that is cffd or cspequivalent to the actual parallel composition this article considers the problem of minimizing the number of successor states of a given state in the reduced lts the problem can be solved by constructing an andorgraph with weighted vertices and by finding a set of vertices that satisfies a certain constraint such that no set of vertices satisfying the constraint has a smaller sum of weights without weights the andorgraph can be constructed in lowdegree polynomial time wrt the length of the input of the problem however since actions can be nondeterministic and transitions can share target states it is not known whether the weights are generally computable in polynomial time consequently it is an open problem whether minimizing the number of successor states is as easy as minimizing the number of successor transitions asymptotical stability in discretetime neural networks in this work we present a proof of the existence of a fixed point and a generalized sufficient condition that guarantees the stability of it in discretetime neural networks by using the lyapunov function method we also show that for both symmetric and asymmetric connections the unique attractor is a fixed point when several conditions are satisfied this is an extended result of chen and aihara see physica d vol 104 no 34 p 286325 1997 in particular we further study the stability of equilibrium in discretetime neural networks with the connection weight matrix in form of an interval matrix finally several examples are shown to illustrate and reinforce our theory a comparison of different decision algorithms used in volumetric storm cells classification decision algorithms useful in classifying meteorological volumetric radar data are discussed such data come from the radar decision support system rdss database of environment canada and concern summer storms created in this country some research groups used the data completed by rdss for verifying the utility of chosen methods in volumetric storm cells classification the paper consists of a review of experiments that were made on the data from rdss database of environment canada and presents the quality of particular classifiers the classification accuracy coefficient is used to express the quality for five research groups that led their experiments in a similar way it was possible to compare received outputs experiments showed that the support vector machine svm method and rough set algorithms which use object oriented reducts for rule generation to classify volumetric storm data perform better than other classifiers verification of nonfunctional properties of a composable architecture with petri nets in this paper we introduce our concept of composability and present the mss architecture as an example for a composable architecture mss claims to be composable with respect to timing properties we discuss how to model and prove properties in such an architecture with timeextended petrinets as a result the first step of a proof of composability is presented as well as a new kind of petri net which is more suitable for modeling architectures like mss global action rules in distributed knowledge systems previously z ras and jm zytkow 2000 introduced and investigated query answering system based on distributed knowledge mining the notion of an action rule was introduced by z ras and a wieczorkowska 2000 and its application domain ebusiness was taken in this paper we generalize the notion of action rules in a similar way to handling global queries mainly when values of attributes for a given customer used in action rules can not be easily changed by business user definitions of these attributes are extracted from other sites of a distributed knowledge system to be more precise attributes at every site of a distributed knowledge system are divided into two sets stable and flexible values of flexible attributes for a given consumer sometime can be changed and this change can be influenced and controlled by a business user however some of these changes for instance to the attribute profit can not be done directly to a chosen attribute in this case definitions of such an attribute in terms of other attributes have to be learned these new definitions are used to construct action rules showing what changes in values of flexible attributes for a given consumer are needed in order to reclassify this consumer the way business user wants but business user may be either unable or unwilling to proceed with actions leading to such changes in all such cases we may search for definitions of these flexible attributes looking at either local or remote sites for help towards an ontology of approximate reason this article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate reason the basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about classifying the particular relative to decision rules derived from data judgment in agents is reflective but not in the classical philosophical sense eg the notion of judgment in kant in an agent a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object input that is a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute sensor values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule in effect this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective not based on a priori conditions or universals this form of judgment is reflective but not in the sense of kant unlike kant a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors conditions in a derived rule again unlike kants notion of judgment a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors rather a reflective judgment by an agent is a form of recognition that a particular vector of sensor values pertains to a particular rule in some degree this recognition takes the form of an assertion that a particular descriptor vector is associated with a particular decision rule these considerations can be repeated for other forms of classifiers besides those defined by decision rules bounded model checking for the universal fragment of ctl bounded model checking bmc has been recently introduced as an efficient verification method for reactive systems bmc based on sat methods consists in searching for a counterexample of a particular length and generating a propositional formula that is satisfiable iff such a counterexampleexists this new technique has been introduced by e clarke et al for model checking of linear time temporal logic ltl our paper shows how the concept of bounded model checking can be extended to actl the universal fragment of ctl the implementation of the algorithm for elementary net systems is described together with the experimental results modeling dynamic objects in distributed systems with nested petri nets nested petri nets npnets is a petri net extension allowing tokens in a net marking to be represented by marked nets themselves the paper discusses applicability of npnets for modeling task planning systems multiagent systems and recursiveparallel systems a comparison of npnets with some other formalisms such as opns of r valk 2000 recursive parallel programs of o kushnarenko and ph schnoebelen 1997 and process algebras is given some aspects of decidability for objectoriented petri net extensions are also discussed a comparative study of some generalized rough approximations in this paper we focus upon a comparison of some generalized rough approximations of sets where the classical indiscernibility relation is generalized to any binary reflexive relation we aim at finding the best of several candidates for generalized rough approximation mappings where both definability of sets by elementary granules of information as well as the issue of distinction among positive negative and border regions of a set are taken into account dynamic modification of object petri nets an application to modelling protocols with forkjoin structures in this paper we discuss possibilities of modelling protocols by objects in objectbased highlevel petri nets some advantages of dynamically modifying the structure of token objects are discussed and the need for further investigations into mathematically rigorous foundations of object net formalisms incorporating facilities for such operations on its token nets is emphasised verification of timed automata based on similarity the paper presents a modification of the standard partitioning technique to generate abstract state spaces preserving similarity for timed automata since this relation is weaker than bisimilarity most of the obtained models state spaces are smaller than bisimilar ones but still preserve the universal fragments of branching time temporal logics the theoretical results are exemplified for strong delay and observational simulation relations placetransition petri net evolutions recording ways analysis and synthesis four semantic domains for placetransition petri nets and their relationships are considered they are monoids of respectively firing sequences processes traces and dependence graphs for each of them the analysis and synthesis problem is stated and solved the monoid of processes is defined in a nonstandard way nets under consideration involve weights of arrows and capacities finite or infinite of places however the analysis and synthesis tasks require nets to be pure ie each of their transition must have the preset and postset disjoint a new result on the global convergence of hopfield neural networks in this work we discuss hopfield neural networks investigating their global stability some sufficient conditions for a class of hopfield neural networks to be globally stable and globally exponentially stable are given products and polymorphic subtypes this paper is devoted to a comprehensive study of polymorphic subtypes with products we first present a sound and complete hilbert style axiomatization of the relation of being a subtype in presence of to   type constructors and the for all quantifier and we show that such axiornatization is not encodable in the system with to  for all only in order to give a logical semantics to such a subtyping relation we propose a new form of a sequent which plays a key role in a natural deduction and a gentzen style calculi interestingly enough the sequent must have the form e implies t where e is a noncommutative nonempty sequence of typing assumptions and t is a finite binary tree of typing judgements each of them behaving like a pushdown store we study basic metamathematical properties of the two logical systems such as subject reduction and cut elimination some decidabilityundecidability issues related to the presented subtyping relation are also explored as expected the subtyping over to   for all is undecidable being already undecidable for the to  for all fragment as proved in 15 but for the  for all fragment it turns out to be decidable a notion of noninterference for timed automata the noninterference property of concurrent systems is a security property concerning the flow of information among different levels of security of the system in this paper we introduce a notion of timed noninterference for realtime systems specified by timed automata the notion is presented using an automata based approach and then it is characterized also by operations and equivalence between timed languages the definition is applied to an example of a timecritical system modeling a simplified control of an airplane completeness of timed mu crl previously a straightforward extension of the process algebra mu crl was proposed to explicitly deal with time the process algebra mu crl has been especially designed to deal with data in a process algebraic context using the features for data only a minor extension of the language was needed to obtain a very expressive variant of time previously it contained syntax operational semantics and axioms characterising timed mu crl it did not contain an in depth analysis of theory of timed mu crl this paper fills this gap by providing soundness and completeness results the main tool to establish these is a mapping of timed to untimed mu crl and employing the completeness results obtained for untimed mu crl upsilon universal programming system with incomplete lazy object notation this paper presents a new model of computation that differs from prior models in that it emphasizes data over flow control has no named variables and has an objectoriented flavor we prove that this model is a complete and confluent acceptable programming system and has a usable type theory a new data synchronization primitive is introduced in order to achieve the above properties subtle variations of the model are shown to fall short of having all these necessary properties a linear time special case for mc games mc games are infinite duration twoplayer games played on graphs deciding the winner in mc games is equivalent to the the modal mucalculus model checking in this article we provide a linear time algorithm for a class of mc games we show that if all cycles in each strongly connected component of the game graph have at least one common vertex the winner can be found in linear time our results hold also for parity games which are equivalent to mc games on fractal dimension in information systems toward exact sets in infinite information systems the notions of an exact as well as a rough set are wellgrounded as basic notions in rough set theory they are however defined in the setting of a finite information system ie an information system having finite numbers of objects as well as attributes in theoretical studies eg of topological properties of rough sets one has to trespass this limitation and to consider information systems with potentially unbound number of attributes in such setting the notions of rough and exact sets may be defined in terms of topological operators of interior and closure with respect to an appropriate topology following the ideas from the finite case where it is noticed that in the finite case roughsettheoretic operators of lower and upper approximation are identical with the interior respectively closure operators in topology induced by equivalence classes of the indiscernibility relation extensions of finite information systems are also desirable from application point of view in the area of knowledge discovery and data mining when demands of eg mass collaboration andor huge experimental data call for need of working with large data tables so the sound theoretical generalization of these cases is an information system with the number of attributes not bound in advance by a fixed integer ie an information system with countably but infinitely many attributes in large information systems a need arises for qualitative measures of complexity of concepts involved free of parameters cf eg applications for the vapnikczervonenkis dimension we study here in the theoretical setting of infinite information system a proposal to apply fractal dimensions suitably modified as measures of concept complexity selfdescribing turing machines after a sketchy historical account on the question of selfdescribeness and selfreproduction and after discussing the definition of suitable encodings for selfdescribeness we give the construction of several selfdescribing turing machines namely selfdescribing machines with respectively 350 267 224 and 206 instructions on average depth of decision trees implementing boolean functions the article considers the representation of boolean functions in the form of decision trees it presents the bounds on average time complexity of decision trees for all classes of boolean functions that are closed over substitution and the insertion and deletion of unessential variables the obtained results are compared with the results developed by mju moshkov 1995 that describe the worst case time complexity of decision trees a modal logic for indiscernibility and complementarity in information systems in this paper we study indiscernibility relations and complementarity relations in information systems the firstorder characterization of indiscernibility and complementarity is obtained through a duality result between information systems and certain structures of relational type characterized by firstorder conditions the modal analysis of indiscernibility and complementarity is performed through a modal logic which modalities correspond to indiscernibility relations and complementarity relations in information systems combining pc control and hmi integrating pcbased control with human machine interface hmi technology can benefit a plant floor system however before one decides on pcbased control there are many things one should consider especially when using a soft programmable logic controller plc to command the inputoutput there are three strategies to integrate a pcbased control system with an hmi treat the pc running the control application as if it were a plc integrate the system using standard pc interfaces or using application programming interfaces phase conditions for schur polynomials the rate of change of phase of a real or complex schur polynomial evaluated along the unit circle traversed counterclockwise is strictly positive for polynomials with real coefficients this bound can be tightened these and some other fundamental bounds on the rate of change of phase are derived here using the tchebyshev representation of the image of a real polynomial evaluated on the unit circle making the mis integration process work focused crossfunctional teams that implement flexible and scalable information systems is can deliver a smooth lean manufacturing process when integrating new technology into an existing facility one should always consider three things the hard infrastructure the soft infrastructure and information flow hard infrastructure includes client and server hardware and network infrastructure soft infrastructure includes operating systems existing or legacy software needed code customizations and the human resources to runsupport the system information flow includes how data in the new system interacts with legacy systems and what legacy data the new system will require as well as who will want to receiveaccess the information that is held by the system taking back control scada system most common way to implement a scada system is to go outside however in the authors opinion to truly take control of a scada project inhouse personnel should handle as much of the job as possible this includes design equipment specification installation and programming the more of these tasks one does inhouse the more control and ownership one has to accomplish this we first evaluated the existing scada system and investigated new technologies to establish a list of features the new system needed to incorporate the heat is on building automation systems integrating building automation systems bass can result in systems that have the ability to sense changes in

truss topology optimization by a modified genetic algorithm this paper describes the use of a stochastic search procedure based on genetic algorithms for developing nearoptimal topologies of loadbearing truss structures most existing cases these publications express the truss topology as a combination of members these methods however have the disadvantage that the resulting topology may include needless members or those which overlap other members in addition to these problems the generated structures are not necessarily structurally stable a new method which resolves these problems by expressing the truss topology as a combination of triangles is proposed in this paper details of the proposed methodology are presented as well as the results of numerical examples that clearly show the effectiveness and efficiency of the method multicriterion optimization of composite laminates for maximum failure margins with an interactive descent algorithm an interactive multicriterion optimization method for composite laminates subjected to multiple loading conditions is introduced laminate margins to initial failure first ply failure fpf with respect of the applied loading conditions are treated as criteria the original problem is reduced to a bicriterion problem by introducing parameters to combine criteria in a linear manner the problem is solved by using an interactive descent algorithm both the conditions required for a discrete procedure to converge towards a pareto optimum and numerical examples are given development of visual design steering as an aid in largescale multidisciplinary design optimization ii method validation for pt i see ibid pp 41224 graph morphing the first concept developed under the newly proposed paradigm of visual design steering vds is applied to optimal design problems graph morphing described in part i of this paper can be used to provide insights to a designer to improve efficiency reliability and accuracy of an optimal design in less cycle time it is demonstrated in this part of the paper that graph morphing can be used to provide insights into design variable impact constraint redundancy reasonable values for constraint allowable limits and function smoothness that otherwise might not be attainable development of visual design steering as an aid in largescale multidisciplinary design optimization i method development a modified paradigm of computational steering cs termed visual design steering vds is developed in this paper the vds paradigm is applied to optimal design problems to provide a means for capturing and enabling designer insights vds allows a designer to make decisions before during or after an analysis or optimization via a visual environment in order to effectively steer the solution process the objective of vds is to obtain a better solution in less time through the use of designer knowledge and expertise using visual representations of complex systems in this manner enables human experience and judgement to be incorporated into the optimal design process at appropriate steps rather than having traditional black box solvers return solutions from a prescribed input set part i of this paper focuses on the research issues pertaining to the graph morphing visualization method created to represent an ndimensional optimization problem using 2dimensional and 3dimensional visualizations part ii investigates the implementation of the vds paradigm using the graph morphing approach to improve an optimal design process specifically the following issues are addressed impact of design variable changes on the optimal design space identification of possible constraint redundancies impact of constraint tolerances on the optimal solution and smoothness of the objective function contours it is demonstrated that graph morphing can effectively reduce the complexity and computational time associated with some optimization problems stochastic optimization of acoustic response  a numerical and experimental comparison the objective of the work presented is to compare results from numerical optimization with experimental data and to highlight and discuss the differences between two fundamentally different optimization methods the problem domain is minimization of acoustic emission and the structure used in the work is a closed cylinder with forced vibration of one end the optimization method used in this paper is simulated annealing sa a stochastic method the results are compared with those from a gradientbased method used on the same structure in an earlier paper tinnsten 2000 an analytical model for a composite adaptive rectangular structure using the heaviside function the objective of this article is to describe a mathematical model based on the heaviside function and on the delta dirac distribution for a composite adaptive rectangular structure with embedded andor bonded piezoelectric actuators and sensors in the adopted structure model the laminae are made up a configuration of rectangular nonpiezoelectric and piezoelectric patches the laminae do not all have the same area nor do they present the same configuration such that there are points where there is no material the equations of motion and the boundary conditions which describe the electromechanical coupling are based on the mindlin displacement field on the linear theory of piezoelectricity and on the hamilton principle how much should publishers spend on technology a study confirms that spending on publishingspecific information technology it resources is growing much faster than it spending for general business activities at least among leading publishers in the scientific technical and medical stm market the survey asked about information technology funding and staffing levelspast present and futureand also inquired about activities in content management web delivery computer support and customer relationship management the results provide a starting point for measuring information technology growth and budget allocations in this publishing segment stability analysis of the characteristic polynomials whose coefficients are polynomials of interval parameters using monotonicity we analyze the stability of the characteristic polynomials whose coefficients are polynomials of interval parameters via monotonicity methods our stability conditions are based on frazerduncans theorem and all conditions can be checked using only endpoint values of interval parameters these stability conditions are necessary and sufficient under the monotonicity assumptions when the monotonicity conditions do not hold on the whole parameter region we present an interval division method and a transformation algorithm in order to apply the monotonicity conditions then our stability analysis methods can be applied to all characteristic polynomials whose coefficients are polynomials of interval parameters resolution of a currentmode algorithmic analogtodigital converter errors limiting the resolution of currentmode algorithmic analogtodigital converters are mainly related to current mirror operation while systematic errors can be

save the photofinishing market a consortium of film suppliers and electronics firms has proposed the common picture exchange environment it will let diverse providers cooperate via the internet to sell digitalphoto prints integrateandfire neurons driven by correlated stochastic input neurons are sensitive to correlations among synaptic inputs however analytical models that explicitly include correlations are hard to solve analytically so their influence on a neurons response has been difficult to ascertain to gain some intuition on this problem we studied the firing times of two simple integrateandfire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation a measure of spiketrain variability as functions of the mean variance and correlation time of the stochastic input the results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions in these models an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains however the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small in addition the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges these results suggest that temporal correlations may play a major role in determining the variability as well as the intensity of neuronal spike trains dynamics of the firing probability of noisy integrateandfire neurons cortical neurons in vivo undergo a continuous bombardment due to synaptic activity which acts as a major source of noise we investigate the effects of the noise filtering by synapses with various levels of realism on integrateandfire neuron dynamics the noise input is modeled by white for instantaneous synapses or colored for synapses with a finite relaxation time noise analytical results for the modulation of firing probability in response to an oscillatory input current are obtained by expanding a fokkerplanck equation for small parameters of the problemwhen both the amplitude of the modulation is small compared to the background firing rate and the synaptic time constant is small compared to the membrane time constant we report the detailed calculations showing that if a synaptic decay time constant is included in the synaptic current model the firingrate modulation of the neuron due to an oscillatory input remains finite in the highfrequency limit with no phase lag in addition we characterize the lowfrequency behavior and the behavior of the highfrequency limit for intermediate decay times we also characterize the effects of introducing a rise time to the synaptic currents and the presence of several synaptic receptors with different kinetics in both cases we determine using numerical simulations an effective decay time constant that describes the neuronal response completely reply to carreiraperpinan and goodhill mathematics in biology in a paper by carreiraperpinan and goodhill see ibid vol14 no7 p154560 2002 the authors apply mathematical arguments to biology swindale et al think it is inappropriate to apply the standards of proof required in mathematics to the acceptance or rejection of scientific hypotheses to give some examples showing that data are well described by a linear model does not rule out an infinity of other possible models that might give better descriptions of the data proving in a mathematical sense that the linear model was correct would require ruling out all other possible models a hopeless task similarly to demonstrate that two dna samples come from the same individual it is sufficient to show a match between only a few regions of the genome even though there remains a very large number of additional comparisons that could be done any one of which might potentially disprove the match this is unacceptable in mathematics but in the real world it is a perfectly reasonable basis for belief centercrossing recurrent neural networks for the evolution of rhythmic behavior a centercrossing recurrent neural network is one in which the nullhypersurfaces of each neuron intersect at their exact centers of symmetry ensuring that each neurons activation function is centered over the range of net inputs that it receives we demonstrate that relative to a random initial population seeding the initial population of an evolutionary search with centercrossing networks significantly improves both the frequency and the speed with which highfitness oscillatory circuits evolve on a simple walking task the improvement is especially striking at low mutation variances our results suggest that seeding with centercrossing networks may often be beneficial since a wider range of dynamics is more likely to be easily accessible from a population of centercrossing networks than from a population of random networks learning nonregular languages a comparison of simple recurrent networks and lstm rodriguez 2001 examined the learning ability of simple recurrent nets srns elman 1990 on simple contextsensitive and contextfree languages in response to rodriguezs 2001 article we compare the performance of simple recurrent nets and long shortterm memory recurrent nets on contextfree and contextsensitive languages scalable hybrid computation with spikes we outline a hybrid analogdigital scheme for computing with three important features that enable it to scale to systems of large complexity first like digital computation which uses several onebit precise logical units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation the hybrid scheme uses several moderateprecision analog units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation second frequent discrete signal restoration of the analog information prevents analog noise and offset from degrading the computation third a state machine enables complex computations to be created using a sequence of elementary computations a natural choice for implementing this hybrid scheme is one based on spikes because spikecount codes are digital while spiketime codes are analog we illustrate how spikes afford easy ways to implement all three components of scalable hybrid computation first as an important example of distributed analog computation we show how spikes can create a distributed modular representation of an analog number by implementing digital carry interactions between spiking analog neurons second we show how signal restoration may be performed by recursive spikecount quantization of spiketime codes third we use spikes from an analog dynamical system to trigger state transitions in a digital dynamical system which reconfigures the analog dynamical system using a binary control vector such feedback interactions between analog and digital dynamical systems create a hybrid state machine hsm the hsm extends and expands the concept of a digital finitestatemachine to the hybrid domain we present experimental data from a twoneuron hsm on a chip that implements errorcorrecting analogtodigital conversion with the concurrent use of spiketime and spikecount codes we also present experimental data from silicon circuits that implement hsmbased pattern recognition using spiketime synchrony we outline how hsms may be used to perform learning vector quantization spike pattern recognition and generation and how they may be reconfigured law librarians survey are academic law librarians in decline the author reports on the results of one extra element in the biallsptl survey designed to acquire further information about academic law librarians the survey has fulfilled the aim of providing a snapshot of the academic law library profession and has examined the concerns that have been raised perhaps most importantly it has shown that more longterm work needs to be done to monitor the situation effectively we hope that biall will take on this challenge and help to maintain the status of academic law librarians and aid them in their work sptlbiall academic law library survey 20002001 the paper outlines the activities and funding of academic law libraries in the uk and ireland in the academic year 20002001 the figures have

its very nature is less immediately accessible than the law of codified statutory systems it calls for an efficient system of law reporting of necessity any such system will be selective the majority of decisions going unreported considerable power thereby comes to repose in the hands of the law reporters the author shares his invaluable perception and extensive research on the difficulties which arise from the excess of access to judgments on biorthogonal nonuniform filter banks and tree structures this paper concerns biorthogonal nonuniform filter banks it is shown that a tree structured filter bank is biorthogonal if it is equivalent to a tree structured filter bank whose matching constituent levels on the analysis and synthesis sides are themselves biorthogonal pairs we then show that a stronger statement can be made about dyadic filter banks in general that a dyadic filter bank is biorthogonal if both the analysis and synthesis banks can be decomposed into dyadic trees we further show that these decompositions are stability and fir preserving these results derived for filter banks having filters with rational transfer functions thus extend some of the earlier comparable results for orthonormal filter banks cat and class what use are these skills to the new legal information professional this article looks at the cataloguing and classification skills taught on information studies courses and the use these skills are to new legal information professionals the article is based on the opinions of nine new legal information professionals from both academic and law firm libraries blended implementation of block implicit methods for odes in this paper we further develop a new approach for naturally defining the nonlinear splittings needed for the implementation of block implicit methods for odes which has been considered by brugnano j comput appl math 116 2000 41 and by brugnano and trigiante in recent trends in numerical analysis nova science new york 2000 pp 81105 the basic idea is that of defining the numerical method as the combination blending of two suitable component methods by carefully choosing such methods it is shown that very efficient implementations can be obtained moreover some of them characterized by a diagonal splitting are well suited for parallel computers numerical tests comparing the performances of the proposed implementation with existing ones are also presented in order to make evident the potential of the approach stability in the numerical solution of the heat equation with nonlocal boundary conditions this paper deals with numerical methods for the solution of the heat equation with integral boundary conditions finite differences are used for the discretization in space the matrices specifying the resulting semidiscrete problem are proved to satisfy a sectorial resolvent condition uniformly with respect to the discretization parameter using this resolvent condition unconditional stability is proved for the fully discrete numerical process generated by applying a theta stable onestep methods to the semidiscrete problem this stability result is established in the maximum norm it improves some previous results in the literature in that it is not subject to various unnatural restrictions which were imposed on the boundary conditions and on the onestep methods a collocation formulation of multistep methods for variable stepsize extensions multistep methods are classically constructed by specially designed difference operators on an equidistant time grid to make them practically useful they have to be implemented by varying the stepsize according to some errorcontrol algorithm it is well known how to extend adams and bdf formulas to a variable stepsize formulation in this paper we present a collocation approach to construct variable stepsize formulas we make use of piecewise polynomials to show that every kstep method of order k1 has a variable stepsize polynomial collocation formulation multitimescale internet traffic engineering the internet is a collection of packetbased hopbyhop routed networks internet traffic engineering is the process of allocating resources to meet the performance requirements of users and operators for their traffic current mechanisms for doing so exemplified by tcps congestion control or the variety of packet marking disciplines concentrate on allocating resources on a perpacket basis or at data timescales this article motivates the need for traffic engineering in the internet at other timescales namely control and management timescales and presents three mechanisms for this it also presents a scenario to show how these mechanisms increase the flexibility of operators service offerings and potentially also ease problems of internet management traffic engineering with traditional ip routing protocols traffic engineering involves adapting the routing of traffic to network conditions with the joint goals of good user performance and efficient use of network resources we describe an approach to intradomain traffic engineering that works within the existing deployed base of interior gateway protocols such as open shortest path first and intermediate systemintermediate system we explain how to adapt the configuration of link weights based on a networkwide view of the traffic and topology within a domain in addition we summarize the results of several studies of techniques for optimizing ospfisis weights to the prevailing traffic the article argues that traditional shortest path routing protocols are surprisingly effective for engineering the flow of traffic in large ip networks understanding internet traffic streams dragonflies and tortoises we present the concept of network traffic streams and the ways they aggregate into flows through internet links we describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of internet streams and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites we find that although most streams about 45 percent of them are dragonflies lasting less than 2 seconds a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days and can carry a high proportion 5060 percent of the total bytes on a given link we define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes we point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime dragonflies and tortoises but also by size mice and elephants and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions we submit that isps need to be aware of the distribution of internet stream sizes and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams in particular any forwarding cache mechanisms in internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams in addition isps should realize that longrunning streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumessomething they may not have allowed for when using traditional flat rate user bandwidth consumption approaches to provisioning and engineering dynamic spectrum management for nextgeneration dsl systems the performance of dsl systems is severely constrained by crosstalk due to the electromagnetic coupling among the multiple twisted pairs making up a phone cable in order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk dsl systems are currently designed under the assumption of worstcase crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative dsl deployments this article presents a new paradigm for dsl system design which takes into account the multiuser aspects of the dsl transmission environment dynamic spectrum management dsm departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems along with this distributed optimization when an additional degree of coordination

electronic commerce environments adaptiveautomatic networkservice intrusion and anomaly detection in wide area data networks and ecommerce infrastructures is fast gaining critical research and practical importance we present and demonstrate the use of a generalpurpose hierarchical multitier multiwindow statistical anomaly detection technology and system that operates automatically adaptively and proactively and can be applied to various networking technologies including both wired and wireless ad hoc networks our method uses statistical models and multivariate classifiers to detect anomalous network conditions some numerical results are also presented that demonstrate that our proposed methodology can reliably detect attacks with traffic anomaly intensity as low as 35 percent of the typical background traffic intensity thus promising to generate an effective early warning routing security in wireless ad hoc networks a mobile ad hoc network consists of a collection of wireless mobile nodes that are capable of communicating with each other without the use of a network infrastructure or any centralized administration manet is an emerging research area with practical applications however wireless manet is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium dynamic topology distributed cooperation and constrained capability routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network in general routing security in wireless manets appears to be a problem that is not trivial to solve in this article we study the routing security issues of manets and analyze in detail one type of attackthe black hole problemthat can easily be employed against the manets we also propose a solution for the black hole problem for ad hoc ondemand distance vector routing protocol a unified view for vector rotational cordic algorithms and architectures based on angle quantization approach vector rotation is the key operation employed extensively in many digital signal processing applications in this paper we introduce a new design concept called angle quantization aq it can be used as a design index for vector rotational operation where the rotational angle is known in advance based on the aq process we establish a unified design framework for costeffective lowlatency rotational algorithms and architectures several existing works such as conventional coordinate rotational digital computer cordic arcordic mvrcordic and eeasbased cordic can be fitted into the design framework forming a vector rotational cordic family moreover we address four searching algorithms to solve the optimization problem encountered in the proposed vector rotational cordic family the corresponding scaling operations of the cordic family are also discussed based on the new design framework we can realize highspeedlowcomplexity rotational vlsi circuits whereas without degrading the precision performance in fixedpoint implementations securing the internet routing infrastructure the unprecedented growth of the internet over the last years and the expectation of an even faster increase in the numbers of users and networked systems resulted in the internet assuming its position as a mass communication medium at the same time the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure however as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows its security becomes a major concern in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure in particular the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks the injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols with a variety of countermeasures which nonetheless have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure in this article we survey the uptodate secure routing schemes that appeared over the last few years our critical point of view and thorough review of the literature are an attempt to identify directions

variabledata composition engine with a web interface though a firstgeneration effort it shows substantial promise lsub p stability and linearization a theorem by hadamard gives a twopart condition under which a map from one banach space to another is a homeomorphism the theorem while often very useful is incomplete in the sense that it does not explicitly specify the family of maps for which the condition is met recently under a typically weak additional assumption on the map it was shown that hadamards condition is met if and only if the map is a homeomorphism with a lipschitz continuous inverse here an application is given concerning the relation between the lsub p stability with 1 or p  infinity  of a nonlinear system and the stability of related linear systems we also give a result that directs attention to a fundamental limitation concerning what can be proved about linearization and stability for a related familiar family of feedback systems strobbe graphics next frontier ctp

p3k  h 3 is k  h if h in 0 2 and k  3 if h  1 for each k or 3 with the single exception of p93 whose crossing number is 2 a shy invariant of graphs moving from a well known result of pl hammer et al 1982 we introduce a new graph invariant say lambda g referring to any graph g it is a nonnegative integer which is nonzero whenever g contains particular induced odd cycles or equivalently admits a particular minimum cliquepartition we show thatg can be efficiently evaluated and that its determination allows one to reduce the hard problem of computing a minimum cliquecover of a graph to an identical problem of smaller size and special structure furthermore one has alpha g or theta g  lambda g where alpha g and theta g respectively denote the cardinality of a maximum stable set of g and of a minimum cliquepartition of g arranging solid balls to represent a graph by solid balls we mean a set of balls in rsup 3 no two of which can penetrate each other every finite graph g can be represented by arranging solid balls in the following way put red balls in rsup 3 one for each vertex of g and connect two red balls by a chain when they correspond to a pair of adjacent vertices of g where a chain means a finite sequence of blue solid balls in which each consecutive balls are tangent we may omit the chain if the two red balls are already tangent the ball number bg of g is the minimum number of balls red and blue necessary to represent g if we put the balls and chains on a table so that all balls sit on the table then the minimum number of balls for g is denoted by btg among other things we prove that bksub 6  8 bksub 7  13 and bsub tksub 5  8bsub tksub 6  14 we also prove that csub 1nsup 3  bksub n  csub 2nsup 3 log n csub 3nsup 4log n  bsub tksub n  csub 4nsup 4 on abelian branched coverings of the sphere we obtain an enumeration formula for the number of weak equivalence classes of the branched a  bcovering of the sphere with mbranch points when a and b are finite abelian groups with a b  1 from this we can deduce an explicit formula for enumerating the weak equivalence classes of pseudofree spherical zp  zqactions on a given surface when p and q are distinct primes some properties of hadamard matrices coming from dihedral groups h kimura 1996 introduced a method to construct hadamard matrices of degree 8n  4 from the dihedral group of order 2n in this paper we study some properties of this construction the chromatic spectrum of mixed hypergraphs a mixed hypergraph is a triple h  x c d where x is the vertex set and each of c d is a list of subsets of x a strict kcoloring of h is a surjection c  x 1 k such that each member of le has two vertices assigned a common value and each member of d has two vertices assigned distinct values the feasible set of h is k h has a strict kcoloring among other results we prove that a finite set of positive integers is the feasible set of some mixed hypergraph if and only if it omits the number i or is an interval starting with 1 for the set s t with 2 or s or t  2 the smallest realization has 2t  s vertices when every member of c union d is a single interval in an underlying linear order on the vertices the feasible set is also a single interval of integers edgecolorings with no large polychromatic stars given a graph g and a positive integer r let fsub rg denote the largest number of colors that can be used in a coloring of eg such that each vertex is incident to at most r colors for all positive integers n and r we determine fsub rksub nn exactly and fsub rksub n within 1 in doing so we disprove a conjecture by y manoussakis et al 1996 a model of periodic oscillation for genetic regulatory systems in this paper we focus on modeling and explaining periodic oscillations in geneprotein systems with a simple nonlinear model and on analyzing effects of time delay on the stability of oscillations our main model of genetic regulation comprises of a twogene system with an autoregulatory feedback loop we exploit multiple time scales and hysteretic properties of the model to construct periodic oscillations with jumping dynamics and analyze the possible mechanism according to the singular perturbation theory as shown in this paper periodic oscillations are mainly generated by nonlinearly negative and positive feedback loops in gene regulatory systems whereas the jumping dynamics is generally caused by time scale differences among biochemical reactions this simple model may actually act as a genetic oscillator or switch in geneprotein networks because the dynamics are robust for parameter perturbations or environment variations we also explore effects of time delay on the stability of the dynamics showing that the time delay generally increases the stability region of the oscillations thereby making the oscillations robust to parameter changes two examples are also provided to numerically demonstrate our theoretical results orthogonal decompositions of complete digraphs a family g of isomorphic copies of a given digraph g is said to be an orthogonal decomposition of the complete digraph dsub n by g if every arc of dsub n belongs to exactly one member of g and the union of any two different elements from g contains precisely one pair of reverse arcs given a digraph h an h family mh is the vertexdisjoint union of m copies of h  in this paper we consider orthogonal decompositions by hfamilies our objective is to prove the existence of such an orthogonal decomposition whenever certain necessary conditions hold and m is sufficiently large stem secure telephony enabled middlebox dynamic applications including ip telephony have not seen wide acceptance within enterprises because of problems caused by the existing network infrastructure static elements including firewalls and network address translation devices are not capable of allowing dynamic applications to operate properly the secure telephony enabled middlebox stem architecture is an enhancement of the existing network design to remove the issues surrounding static devices the architecture incorporates an improved firewall that can interpret and utilize information in the application layer of packets to ensure proper functionality in addition to allowing dynamic applications to function normally the stem architecture also incorporates several detection and response mechanisms for wellknown networkbased vulnerabilities this article describes the key components of the architecture with respect to the sip protocol defending against floodingbased distributed denialofservice attacks a tutorial floodingbased distributed denialofservice ddos attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the internet in a typical ddos attack a large number of compromised hosts are amassed to send useless packets to jam a victim or its internet connection or both in the last two years it was discovered that ddos attack methods and tools are becoming more sophisticated effective and also more difficult to trace to the real attackers on the defense side current technologies are still unable to withstand largescale attacks the main purpose of this article is therefore twofold the first one is to describe various ddos attack methods and to present a systematic review and evaluation of the existing defense mechanisms the second is to discuss a longerterm solution dubbed the internetfirewall approach that attempts to intercept attack packets in the internet core well before reaching the victim estimating the intrinsic dimension of data with a fractalbased method in this paper the problem of estimating the intrinsic dimension of a data set is investigated a fractalbased approach using the grassbergerprocaccia algorithm is proposed since the grassbergerprocaccia algorithm 1983 performs badly on sets of high dimensionality an empirical procedure that improves the original algorithm has been developed the procedure has been tested on data sets of known dimensionality and on time series of santa fe competition restoration of archival documents using a wavelet technique this paper addresses a problem of restoring handwritten archival documents by recovering their contents from the interfering handwriting on the reverse side caused by the seeping of ink we present a novel method that works by first matching both sides of a document such that the interfering strokes are mapped with the corresponding strokes originating from the reverse side this facilitates the identification of the foreground and interfering strokes a wavelet reconstruction process then iteratively enhances the foreground strokes and smears the interfering strokes so as to strengthen the discriminating capability of an improved canny edge detector against the interfering strokes the method has been shown to restore the documents effectively with average precision and recall rates for foreground text extraction at 84 percent and 96 percent respectively infraredimage classification using hidden markov trees an image of a threedimensional target is generally characterized by the visible target subcomponents with these dictated by the targetsensor orientation target pose an image often changes quickly with variable pose we define a class as a set of contiguous targetsensor orientations over which the associated target image is relatively stationary with aspect each target is in general characterized by multiple classes a distinct set of wiener filters are employed for each class of images to identify the presence of target subcomponents a karhunenloeve representation is used to minimize the number of filters templates associated with a given subcomponent the statistical relationships between the different target subcomponents are modeled via a hidden markov tree hmt the hmt classifier is discussed and example results are presented for forwardlookinginfrared flir imagery of several vehicles automatic multilevel thresholding for image segmentation by the growing time adaptive selforganizing map in this paper a growing tasom time adaptive selforganizing map network called gtasom along with a peak finding process is proposed for automatic multilevel thresholding the proposed gtasom is tested for image segmentation experimental results demonstrate that the gtasom is a reliable and accurate tool for image segmentation and its results outperform other thresholding methods a maximumlikelihood surface estimator for dense range data describes how to estimate 3d surface models from dense sets of noisy range data taken from different points of view ie multiple range maps the proposed method uses a sensor model to develop an expression for the likelihood of a 3d surface conditional on a set of noisy range measurements optimizing this likelihood with respect to the model parameters provides an unbiased and efficient estimator the proposed numerical algorithms make this estimation computationally practical for a wide variety of circumstances the results from this method compare favorably with stateoftheart approaches that rely on the closestpoint or perpendicular distance metric a convenient heuristic that produces biased solutions and fails completely when surfaces are not sufficiently smooth as in the case of complex scenes or noisy range measurements empirical results on both simulated and real ladar data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for several different types of problems furthermore the proposed method offers a general framework that can accommodate extensions to include surface priors more sophisticated noise models and other sensing modalities such as sonar or synthetic aperture radar reconstructing surfaces by volumetric regularization using radial basis functions we present a new method of surface reconstruction that generates smooth and seamless models from sparse noisy nonuniform and low resolution range data data acquisition techniques from computer vision such as stereo range images and space carving produce 3d point sets that are imprecise and nonuniform when compared to laser or optical range scanners traditional reconstruction algorithms designed for dense and precise data do not produce smooth reconstructions when applied to visionbased data sets our method constructs a 3d implicit surface formulated as a sum of weighted radial basis functions we achieve three primary advantages over existing algorithms 1 the implicit functions we construct estimate the surface well in regions where there is little data 2 the reconstructed surface is insensitive to noise in data acquisition because we can allow the surface to approximate rather than exactly interpolate the data and 3 the reconstructed surface is locally detailed yet globally smooth because we use radial basis functions that achieve multiple orders of smoothness efficient simplicial reconstructions of manifolds from their samples an algorithm for manifold learning is presented given only samples of a finitedimensional differentiable manifold and no a priori knowledge of the manifolds geometry or topology except for its dimension the goal is to find a description of the manifold the learned manifold must approximate the true manifold well both geometrically and topologically when the sampling density is sufficiently high the proposed algorithm constructs a simplicial complex based on approximations to the tangent bundle of the manifold an important property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends on the dimension of the manifold rather than that of the embedding space successful examples are presented in the cases of learning curves in the plane curves in space and surfaces in space in addition a case when the algorithm fails is analyzed hysteretic threshold logic and quasidelay insensitive asynchronous design we introduce the class of hysteretic linearthreshold hlt logic functions as a novel extension of linear threshold logic and prove their general applicability for constructing stateholding boolean functions we then demonstrate a fusion of hlt logic with the quasidelay insensitive style of asynchronous circuit design complete with logical design examples future research directions are also identified generalized mosaicing wide field of view multispectral imaging we present an approach to significantly enhance the spectral resolution of imaging systems by generalizing image mosaicing a filter transmitting spatially varying spectral bands is rigidly attached to a camera as the system moves it senses each scene point multiple times each time in a different spectral band this is an additional dimension of the generalized mosaic paradigm which has demonstrated yielding high radiometric dynamic range images in a wide field of view using a spatially varying density filter the resulting mosaic represents the spectrum at each scene point the image acquisition is as easy as in traditional image mosaics we derive an efficient scene sampling rate and use a registration method that accommodates the spatially varying properties of the filter using the data acquired by this method we demonstrate scene rendering under different simulated illumination spectra we are also able to infer information about the scene illumination the approach was tested using a standard 8bit blackwhite video camera and a fixed spatially varying spectral interference filter analytic pca construction for theoretical analysis of lighting variability in images of a lambertian object we analyze theoretically the subspace best approximating images of a convex lambertian object taken from the same viewpoint but under different distant illumination conditions we analytically construct the principal component analysis for images of a convex lambertian object explicitly taking attached shadows into account and find the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues with respect to lighting variability our analysis makes use of an analytic formula for the irradiance in terms of sphericalharmonic coefficients of the illumination and shows under appropriate assumptions that the principal components or eigenvectors are identical to the spherical harmonic basis functions evaluated at the surface normal vectors our main contribution is in extending these results to the singleviewpoint case showing how the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues are affected when only a limited subset the upper hemisphere of normals is available and the spherical harmonics are no longer orthonormal over the restricted domain our results are very close both qualitatively and quantitatively to previous empirical observations and represent the first essentially complete theoretical explanation of these observations elastically adaptive deformable models we present a technique for the automatic adaptation of a deformable models elastic parameters within a kalman filter framework for shape estimation applications the novelty of the technique is that the models elastic parameters are not constant but spatiotemporally varying the variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance each pass of the algorithm uses physicsbased modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data by augmenting the state equations of an extended kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation therefore the models elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and they are subsequently modified depending on the data and the noise distribution we present results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for both twodimensional and threedimensional data generalized spatiochromatic diffusion a framework for diffusion of color images is presented the method is based on the theory of thermodynamics of irreversible transformations which provides a suitable basis for designing correlations between the different color channels more precisely we derive an equation for color evolution which comprises a purely spatial diffusive term and a nonlinear term that depends on the interactions among color channels over space we apply the proposed equation to images represented in several color spaces such as rgb cielab opponent colors and ihs design and analysis of optimal material distribution policies in flexible manufacturing systems using a single agv modern automated manufacturing processes employ automated guided vehicles agvs for material handling which serve several machine centres mc in a factory optimal scheduling of agvs can significantly help to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing process by minimizing the idle time of mcs waiting for the raw materials we analyse the requirements for an optimal schedule and then provide a mathematical framework for an efficient schedule of material delivery by an agv a mathematical model is developed and then a strategy for optimal material distribution of the available raw material to the mcs is derived with this model the optimal number of mcs to be utilized is also determined finally the material delivery schedule employing multiple journeys to the mcs by the agv is carried out through rigorous analysis and simulation experiments we show that such a delivery strategy will optimize the overall performance comparison of push and pull systems with transporters a metamodelling approach analyses push and pull systems with transportation consideration a multiproduct multiline multistage production system was used to compare the two systems the effects of four factors processing time variation demand variation transporters batch size on throughput rate average waiting time in the system and machine utilization were studied the study uses metamodels to compare the two systems they serve a dual purpose of expressing system performance measures in the form of a simple equation and reducing computational time when comparing the two systems research shows that the number of transporters used and the batch size have a significant effect on the performance measures of both systems fiveaxis nc milling of ruled surfaces optimal geometry of a conical tool the side milling of ruled surfaces using a conical milling cutter was studied this is a field that has largely been ignored by research scientists but it is much used in industry especially to machine turbine blades we first suggest an improved positioning with respect to the directrices of the ruled surface as compared with the methods already developed for the cylindrical cutter this positioning enables the error between the cutter and the workpiece to be reduced an algorithm is then introduced to calculate error so one can determine the cutter dimensions cone radius and angle in order to respect the tolerance interval imposed by the design office this study provides an opportunity to determine cutters with greater dimensions thus alleviating bending problems during milling work sequencing in a manufacturing cell with limited labour constraints this study focuses on the analysis of group scheduling heuristics in a dualconstrained automated manufacturing cell where labour utilization is limited to setups teardowns and loadsunloads this scenario is realistic in todays automated manufacturing cells the results indicate that policies for allocating labour to tasks have very little impact in such an environment furthermore the performance of efficiency oriented exhaustive group scheduling heuristics deteriorated while the performance of the more complex nonexhaustive heuristics improved thus it is recommended that production managers use the simplest labour scheduling policy and instead focus their efforts to activities such as job scheduling and production planning in such environments analysis of the surface roughness and dimensional accuracy capability of fused deposition modelling processes building up materials in layers poses significant challenges from the viewpoint of material science heat transfer and applied mechanics however numerous aspects of the use of these technologies have yet to be studied one of these aspects is the characterization of the surface roughness and dimensional precision obtainable in layered manufacturing processes in this paper a study of roughness parameters obtained through the use of these manufacturing processes was made prototype parts were manufactured using fdm techniques and an experimental analysis of the resulting roughness average rsub a and rms roughness rsub q obtained through the use of these manufacturing processes was carried out dimensional parameters were also studied in order to determine the capability of the fused deposition modelling process for manufacturing parts on fuzzy and probabilistic control charts in this article different procedures of constructing control charts for linguistic data based on fuzzy and probability theory are discussed three sets of membership functions with different degrees of fuzziness are proposed for fuzzy approaches a comparison between fuzzy and probability approaches based on the average run length and samples under control is conducted for real data contrary to the conclusions of raz and wang 1990 the choice of degree of fuzziness affected the sensitivity of control charts design of 1d and 2d variable fractional delay allpass filters using weighted leastsquares method in this paper a weighted leastsquares method is presented to design onedimensional and twodimensional variable fractional delay allpass filters first each coefficient of the variable allpass filter is expressed as the polynomial of the fractional delay parameter then the nonlinear phase error is approximated by a weighted equation error such that the cost function can be converted into a quadratic form next by minimizing the weighted equation error the optimal polynomial coefficients can be obtained iteratively by solving a set of linear simultaneous equations at each iteration finally the design examples are demonstrated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach automated post bonding inspection by using machine vision techniques inspection plays an important role in the semiconductor industry in this paper we focus on the inspection task after wire bonding in packaging the purpose of wire bonding wb is to connect the bond pads with the lead fingers two major types of defects are 1 bonding line missing and 2 bonding line breakage the numbers of bonding lines and bonding balls are used as the features for defect classification the proposed method consists of image preprocessing orientation determination connection detection bonding line detection bonding ball detection and defect classification the proposed method is simple and fast the experimental results show that the proposed method can detect the defects effectively adaptive scheduling of batch servers in flow shops batch servicing is a common way of benefiting from economies of scale in manufacturing operations good examples of production systems that allow for batch processing are ovens found in the aircraft industry and in semiconductor manufacturing in this paper we study the issue of dynamic scheduling of such systems within the context of multistage flow shops so far a great deal of research has concentrated on the development of control strategies which only address the batch stage this paper proposes an integral scheduling approach that also includes succeeding stages in this way we aim for shop optimization instead of optimizing performance for a single stage our socalled lookahead strategy adapts its scheduling decision to shop status which includes information on a limited number of nearfuture arrivals in particular we study a twostage flow shop in which the batch stage is succeeded by a serial stage the serial stage may be realized by a single machine or by parallel machines through an extensive simulation study it is demonstrated how shop performance can be improved by the proposed strategy relative to existing strategies process planning for reliable highspeed machining of moulds a method of generating nc programs for the highspeed milling of moulds is investigated forging dies and injection moulds whether plastic or aluminium have a complex surface geometry in addition they are made of steels of hardness as much as 30 or even 50 hrc since 1995 highspeed machining has been much adopted by the diemaking industry which with this technology can reduce its use of sinking electrodischarge machining sedm edm in general calls for longer machining times the use of highspeed machining makes it necessary to redefine the preliminary stages of the process in addition it affects the methodology employed in the generation of nc programs which requires the use of highlevel cam software the aim is to generate errorfree programs that make use of optimum cutting strategies in the interest of productivity and surface quality the final result is a more reliable manufacturing process there are two risks in the use of highspeed milling on hardened steels one of these is tool breakage which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the workpiece the other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece or fixtures the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings in the spindles in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that new control and optimization steps be included in the cam methodology there are three things that the firm adopting highspeed methods should do it should redefine its process engineering it should systematize access by its cam programmers to highspeed knowhow and it should take up the use of process simulation tools in the latter case it will be very advantageous to use tools for the estimation of cutting forces the new work methods proposed in this article have made it possible to introduce high speed milling hsm into the die industry examples are given of how the technique has been applied with cam programming reengineered as here proposed with an explanation of the novel features and the results heuristics for singlepass welding task sequencing welding task sequencing is a prerequisite in the offline programming of robot arc welding singlepass welding task sequencing can be modelled as a modified travelling salesman problem owing to the difficulty of the resulting arcrouting problems effective local search heuristics are developed computational speed becomes important because robot arc welding is often part of an automated processplanning procedure generating a reasonable solution in an acceptable time is necessary for effective automated process planning several different heuristics are proposed for solving the welding tasksequencing problem considering both productivity and the potential for welding distortion constructive heuristics based on the nearest neighbour concept and tabu search heuristics are developed and enhanced using improvement procedures the effectiveness of the heuristics developed is tested and verified on actual welded structure problems and random problems an adaptive spherefitting method for sequential tolerance control the machining of complex parts typically involves a logical and chronological sequence of n operations on m machine tools because manufacturing datums cannot always match design constraints some of the design specifications imposed on the part are usually satisfied by distinct subsets of the n operations prescribed in the process plan conventional tolerance control specifies a fixed set point for each operation and a permissible variation about this set point to insure compliance with the specifications whereas sequential tolerance control stc uses realtime measurement information at the completion of one stage to reposition the set point for subsequent operations however it has been shown that earlier spherefitting methods for stc can lead to inferior solutions when the process distributions are skewed this paper introduces an extension of stc that uses an adaptive spherefitting method that significantly improves the yield in the presence of skewed distributions as well as significantly reducing the computational effort required by earlier probabilistic search methods deadlockfree scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems using petri nets this paper addresses the deadlockfree scheduling problem in flexible manufacturing systems an efficient deadlockfree scheduling algorithm was developed using timed petri nets for a class of fmss called systems of sequential systems with shared resources ssup 4 r the algorithm generates a partial reachability graph to find the optimal or nearoptimal deadlockfree schedule in terms of the firing sequence of the transitions of the petri net model the objective is to minimize the mean flow time mft an efficient truncation technique based on the siphon concept has been developed and used to generate the minimum necessary portion of the reachability graph to be searched it has been shown experimentally that the developed siphon truncation technique enhances the ability to develop deadlockfree schedules of systems with a high number of deadlocks which cannot be achieved using standard petri net scheduling approaches it may be necessary in some cases to relax the optimality condition for large fmss in order to make the search effort reasonable hence a user control factor ucf was defined and used in the scheduling algorithm the objective of using the ucf is to achieve an acceptable tradeoff between the solution quality and the search effort its effect on the mft and the cpu time has been investigated randomly generated examples are used for illustration and comparison although the effect of ucf did not affect the mean flow time it was shown that increasing it reduces the search effort cpu time significantly a fuzzysoft learning vector quantization for control chart pattern recognition this paper presents a supervised competitive learning network approach called a fuzzysoft learning vector quantization for control chart pattern recognition unnatural patterns in control charts mean that there are some unnatural causes for variations in statistical process control spc hence control chart pattern recognition becomes more important in spc in order to detect effectively the patterns for the six main types of control charts pham and oztemel 1994 described a class of pattern recognizers for control charts based on the learning vector quantization lvq such as lvq lvq2 and lvqx etc in this paper we propose a new supervised lvq for control charts based on a fuzzysoft competitive learning network the proposed fuzzysoft lvq fslvq uses a fuzzy relaxation technique and simultaneously updates all neurons it can increase correct recognition accuracy and also decrease the learning time comparisons between lvq lvqx and fslvq are made the set of justintime management strategies an assessment of their impact on plantlevel productivity and inputfactor substitutability using variable cost function estimates many manufacturers in the automobile industry around the world have adopted the justintime jit set of management strategies in an effort to improve productivity efficiency and product quality the paper provides empirical evidence that supports the idea that jit manufacturing environments are in fact more productive than their nonjit counterparts plantlevel crosssectional data from autoparts manufacturing firms are used to estimate variable cost functions for a jit group as well as for a nonjit group of plants differences in cost function characteristics between the two groups are examined and discussed exploratory study of the adoption of manufacturing technology innovations in the usa and the uk manufacturing technologies appropriately implemented provide competitive advantage to manufacturers the use of manufacturing technologies across countries is difficult to compare one such comparison has been provided in the literature with a study of us and japanese practices in advanced manufacturing technology use using a common questionnaire the present study compares the use of 17 different technologies in similar industries in the usa n1025 and uk n166 using a common questionnaire largely there are remarkable similarities between the two countries this may partly correlate with the heavy traffic in foreign direct investment between the two nations notable differences are 1 acrosstheboard us manufacturers are ahead of the uk firms in computerized integration with units inside and outside manufacturing organizations 2 us manufacturers show higher labour productivity which is consistent with macroeconomic data and 3 more uk manufacturers report the use of soft technologies such as justintime total quality manufacturing and manufacturing cells hypotheses for future investigation are proposed use of bayesian belief networks when combining disparate sources of information in the safety assessment of softwarebased systems the paper discusses how disparate sources of information can be combined in the safety assessment of softwarebased systems the emphasis is put on an emerging methodology relevant for intelligent productsupport systems to combine information about disparate evidences systematically based on bayesian belief networks the objective is to show the link between basic information and the confidence one can have in a system how one combines the bayesian belief net bbn method with a software safety standard rtcado178b for safety assessment of softwarebased systems is also discussed finally the applicability of the bbn methodology and experiences from cooperative research work together with kongsberg defence  aerospace and det norske veritas and ongoing research with vtt automation are presented an efficient dipie algorithm for cad of electrostatically actuated mems devices pullin parameters are important properties of electrostatic actuators efficient and accurate analysis tools that can capture these parameters for different design geometries are therefore essential current simulation tools approach the pullin state by iteratively adjusting the voltage applied across the actuator electrodes the convergence rate of this scheme gradually deteriorates as the pullin state is approached moreover the convergence is inconsistent and requires many mesh and accuracy refinements to assure reliable predictions as a result the design procedure of electrostatically actuated mems devices can be timeconsuming in this paper a novel displacement iteration pullin extraction dipie scheme is presented the dipie scheme is shown to converge consistently and far more rapidly than the voltage iterations vi scheme 100 times faster the dipie scheme requires separate mechanical and electrostatic field solvers therefore it can be easily implemented in existing moems cad packages moreover using the dipie scheme the pullin parameters extraction can be performed in a fully automated mode and no user input for search bounds is required integrated support based on task models for the design evaluation and documentation of interactive safetycritical systems a case study in the airtraffic control domain this paper presents an approach to using task models in both the design and the evaluation phases of interactive safetycritical applications we explain how it is possible to use information contained in task models to support the design and development of effective user interfaces moreover we show how task models can also support a systematic inspectionbased usability assessment by examining possible deviations that can occur while users interact with the system an important issue especially when coping with the peculiar requirements of safetycritical applications such evaluation provides useful technical documentation to help users achieve an indepth understanding of the system and its design rationale lastly a description of the application of our approach to a real case study in the airtraffic control domain will illustrate the main features of the proposed method in particular we discuss examples taken from an application for airtraffic controllers in an aerodrome supported by graphical user interfaces for datalink communications with pilots design methodology for diagnostic strategies for industrial systems this paper presents a method for the construction of diagnostic systems for complex industrial applications the approach has been explicitely developed to shorten the design cycle and meet some specific requirements such as modularity flexibility and the possibility of merging many different sources of information the method allows one to consider multiple simultaneous failures and is specifically designed to make easier the coordination and simplification of local diagnostic algorithms developed by different teams knowledge acquisition and ontology modelling for construction of a control and monitoring expert system this paper presents the processes of knowledge acquisition and ontology development for structuring the knowledge base of an expert system ontological engineering is a process that facilitates construction of the knowledge base of an intelligent system ontology is the study of the organization and classification of knowledge ontological engineering in artificial intelligence has the practical goal of constructing frameworks for knowledge that allow computational systems to tackle knowledgeintensive problems and it supports knowledge sharing and reuse to illustrate the process of conceptual modelling using the inferential modelling technique as a basis for ontology construction the tool and processes are applied to build an expert system in the domain of monitoring of a petroleumproduction facility agentbased productsupport logistics system using xml and rdf the capability of the timely provision of maintenance services and service parts is critical to the competitiveness of industrial systems to enhance the timely operations in a productsupport logistics chain business partners equipment manufacturers parts distributors customers may have to collaborate for the efficient exchange of relevant information we propose the architecture of an agentbased productsupport logistics system emphasis is placed on the problems of sharing and exchanging information through agent communication we adopt the resource description framework rdf schema for information modelling in productsupport logistics domain the extensible markup language xml serialization generates messages for agent communication the use of xml and rdf enables software agents to understand the contents of messages correctly and consistently we demonstrate the feasibility of our agent architecture using a scenario in logistical support processes we believe that the approach can provide a promising way to the automation of business processes in productsupport logistics through seamless communication among the partners using technology to facilitate the design and delivery of warnings this paper describes several ways in which new technologies can assist in the design and delivery of warnings there are four discussion points 1 current product information can be delivered via the internet 2 computer software and hardware are available to assist in the design construction and production of visual and auditory warnings 3 various detection devices can be used to recognize instances in which warnings might be delivered and 4 a warning presentation can be modified to fit conditions and persons implications example applications and future prospects of these points are described evaluation of the usability of digital maintenance manuals developed without either user input or a task analysis the primary objective was to investigate the value that can be added to a lowcost digital maintenance manual by the addition of a navigational aid two versions of a digital maintenance manual were developed the difference between them being the number of design heuristics observed when designing navigational aids neither version was based on an analysis of the tasks carried out by users nor were users involved in the design process instead the manuals were developed directly from the digital information used to produce the existing paper manual usability trials were carried out to test both versions according to the time taken and errors committed by users during typical information retrieval tasks users were questioned to determine their ease of use eou perceptions for each manual the main outcomes were that the navigation aid used in the second version reduced the time taken to use the manual but increased the number of errors made by users the navigational aid also seemed to reduce the perceived eou compared with the first version in both cases the perceived eou was lower than for a previous digital manual that had been developed using a task analysis and user input the paper concludes by recommending the development of a generic task model of user interaction with digital maintenance manuals enhanced product support through intelligent product manuals the scope of this paper is the provision of intelligent product support within the distributed intranetinternet environment from the point of view of user requirements the limitations of conventional product manuals and methods of authoring them are first outlined it is argued that enhanced product support requires new technology solutions both for product manuals and for their authoring and presentation the concept and the architecture of intelligent product manuals are then discussed a prototype system called proartweb is presented to demonstrate advanced features of intelligent product manuals next the problem of producing such manuals in a costeffective way is addressed and a concurrent engineering approach to their authoring is proposed an integrated environment for collaborative authoring called proauthor is described to illustrate the approach suggested and to show how consistent uptodate and userorientedproduct manuals can be designed the solutions presented here enable product knowledge to be captured and delivered to users and developers of product manuals when where and in the form they need it open hypermedia for product support as industrial systems become increasingly more complex the maintenance and operating information increases both in volume and complexity with the current pressures on manufacturing the management of information resources has become a critical issue in particular ensuring that personnel can access current information quickly and effectively when undertaking a specific task this paper discusses some of the issues involved in and the benefits of using open hypermedia to manage and deliver a diverse range of information while the paper concentrates on the problems specifically associated with manufacturing organizations the problems are generic across other business sectors such as healthcare defence and finance the open hypermedia approach to information management and delivery allows a multimedia resource base to be used for a range of applications and it permits a user to have controlled access to the required information in an easily accessible and structured manner recent advancement in hypermedia also permits justintime support in the most appropriate format for all users our approach is illustrated by the discussion of a case study in which an open hypermedia system delivers maintenance and process information to factoryfloor users to support the maintenance and operation of a very large manufacturing cell development of an internetbased intelligent design support system for rolling element bearings this paper presents a novel approach to developing an intelligent agile design system for rolling bearings based on artificial intelligence ai internet and web technologies and expertise the underlying philosophy of the approach is to use ai technology and webbased design support systems as smart tools from which design customers can rapidly and responsively access the systems builtin design expertise the approach is described in detail with a novel ai model and system implementation issues the major issues in implementing the approach are discussed with particular reference to using ai technologies network programming clientserver technology and open computing of bearing design and manufacturing requirements webbased intelligent helpdesksupport environment with the advent of internet technology it is now feasible to provide effective and efficient helpdesk service over the global internet to meet customers requirements and satisfaction in this research we have designed and developed a webbased intelligent helpdesksupport environment webhotline to support the customer service centre of a large multinational corporation in the electronics industry the paper describes the basic architecture of the environment that supports the major functions of webbased fault information retrieval online multilingual translation capability different operating modes of videoconferencing for enhanced support and direct intelligent fault diagnosis by customers or customer support engineers as a result webhotline helps to save cost in eliminating the expensive overseas telephone charges reduction in machine down time and number of onsite visits by service engineers as in traditional helpdesk environment optical actuation of a bistable mems this paper presents an optical actuation scheme for mems devices based on the wellestablished fact that light possesses momentum and hence imparts a force equal to 2 wc when reflected by a surface here w is the total power of the reflected light and c is the speed of light radiation pressure as it is known is nearly insignificant for most macroscale applications but it can be quite significant for mems devices in addition light actuation offers a new paradigm first intersecting light beams do not interfere in contrast to electrical conductors which short when they come into contact second light can operate in high temperature and high radiation environments far outside the capability of solid state electronic components this actuation method is demonstrated both in air and in vacuum by switching the state of a bistable mems device the associated heat transfer model is also presented a featurepreserving volumetric technique to merge surface triangulations several extensions and improvements to surface merging procedures based on the extraction of isosurfaces from a distance map defined on an adaptive background grid are presented the main objective is to extend the application of these algorithms to surfaces with sharp edges and comers in order to deal with objects of different length scales the initial background grids are created using a delaunay triangulation method and local voxelizations a point enrichment technique that introduces points into the background grid along detected surface features such as ridges is used to ensure that these features are preserved in the final merged surface the surface merging methodology is extended to include other boolean operations between surface triangulations the isosurface extraction algorithms are modified to obtain the correct isosurface for multicomponent objects the procedures are demonstrated with various examples ranging from simple geometrical entities to complex engineering applications the present algorithms allow realistic modelling of a large number of complex engineering geometries using overlapping components defined discretely ie via surface triangulations this capability is very useful for grid generation starting from data originated in measurements or images an augmented spatial digital tree algorithm for contact detection in computational mechanics based on the understanding of existing spatial digital treebased contact detection approaches and the alternating digital tree adt algorithm in particular a more efficient algorithm termed the augmented spatial digital tree asdt algorithm is proposed in the present work the asdt algorithm adopts a different point representation scheme that uses only the lower comer vertex to represent a hyperrectangle with the upper comer vertex serving as the augmented information consequently the asdt algorithm can keep the working space the same as the original ndimensional space and in general a much better balanced tree can be expected this together with the introduction of an additional bounding subregion for the rectangles associated with each tree node makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of node visits in the region search although each node visit may be slightly more expensive three examples arising in computational mechanics are presented to provide an assessment of the performance of the asdt the numerical results indicate that the asdt is at least over 39 times faster than the adt loop restructuring for data io minimization on limited onchip memory embedded processors in this paper we propose a framework for analyzing the flow of values and their reuse in loop nests to minimize data traffic under the constraints of limited onchip memory capacity and dependences our analysis first undertakes fusion of possible loop nests intraprocedurally and then performs loop distribution the analysis discovers the closeness factor of two statements which is a quantitative measure of data traffic saved per unit memory occupied if the statements were under the same loop nest over the case where they are under different loop nests we then develop a greedy algorithm which traverses the program dependence graph to group statements together under the same loop nest legally to promote maximal reuse per unit of memory occupied we implemented our framework in petit a tool for dependence analysis and loop transformations we compared our method with one based on tiling of fused loop nest and one based on a greedy strategy to purely maximize reuse we show that our methods work better than both of these strategies in most cases for processors such as tms320cxx which have a very limited amount of onchip memory the improvements in data io range from 10 to 30 percent over tiling and from 10 to 40 percent over maximal reuse for jpeg loops semantic data broadcast for a mobile environment based on dynamic and adaptive chunking database broadcast is an effective and scalable approach to disseminate information of high affinity to a large collection of mobile clients a common problem of existing broadcast approaches is the lack of knowledge for a client to determine if all data items satisfying its query could be obtained from the broadcast we therefore propose a semanticbased broadcast approach a semantic descriptor is attached to each broadcast unit called a data chunk this semantic descriptor allows a client to determine if a query can be answered entirely based on broadcast items and if needed identify the precise definition of the remaining items in the form of a supplementary query data chunks can be of static or dynamic sizes and organized hierarchically their boundary can be determined onthefly adaptive to the nature of client queries we investigate different ways of organizing the data chunks over a broadcast channel to improve access performance we introduce the data affinity index metric which more accurately reflects clientperceived performance a simulation model is built to evaluate our semanticbased broadcast schemes data allocation on wireless broadcast channels for efficient query processing data broadcast is an excellent method for efficient data dissemination in the mobile computing environment the application domain of data broadcast will be widely expanded in the near future where the client is expected to perform complex queries or transactions on the broadcast data to reduce the access latency for processing the complex query it is beneficial to place the data accessed in a query close to each other on the broadcast channel in this paper we propose an efficient algorithm to determine the allocation of the data on the broadcast channel such that frequently coaccessed data are not only allocated close to each other but also in a particular order which optimizes the performance of query processing our mechanism is based on the wellknown problem named optimal linear ordering experiments are performed to justify the benefit of our approach cache invalidation and replacement strategies for locationdependent data in mobile environments mobile locationdependent information services ldiss have become increasingly popular in recent years however data caching strategies for ldiss have thus far received little attention in this paper we study the issues of cache invalidation and cache replacement for locationdependent data under a geometric location model we introduce a new performance criterion called caching efficiency and propose a generic method for locationdependent cache invalidation strategies in addition two cache replacement policies pa and paid are proposed unlike the conventional replacement policies pa and paid take into consideration the valid scope area of a data value we conduct a series of simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes the experimental results show that the proposed locationdependent invalidation scheme is very effective and the pa and paid policies significantly outperform the conventional replacement policies when the unexpected happens disaster planning in banks a business disruption can be as simple as a power failure or as complex as a terrorist attack

armstrong laing group ceo mike sherratt argues that businesses need specialists with an abm focus to keep up with their requirements in such a climate he looks at what benefits a bestofbreed abm system can offer businesses and contends that businesses must choose carefully when going down the abm route  and also ask themselves the question whether generalist organisations will be able to deliver the best possible abm solution equilibrium swelling and kinetics of phresponsive hydrogels models experiments and simulations the widespread application of ionic hydrogels in a number of applications like control of microfluidic flow development of musclelike actuators filtrationseparation and drug delivery makes it important to properly understand these materials understanding hydrogel properties is also important from the standpoint of their similarity to many biological tissues typically gel size is sensitive to outer solution ph and salt concentration in this paper we develop models to predict the swellingdeswelling of hydrogels in buffered ph solutions an equilibrium model has been developed to predict the degree of swelling of the hydrogel at a given ph and salt concentration in the solution a kinetic model has been developed to predict the rate of swelling of the hydrogel when the solution ph is changed experiments are performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the hydrogel in different ph solutions the degree of swelling as well as the rate of swelling of the hydrogel are also studied through experiments the simulations are compared with experimental results and the models are found to predict the swellingdeswelling processes accurately data quality  unlocking the roi in crm while many organisations realise their most valuable asset is their customers many more fail to realise the importance of auditing maintaining and updating the information contained in their customer databases todays growing awareness in the importance of data quality in relation to crm and roi will help change this attitude in response crm vendors will follow suit and begin to differentiate themselves by offering data quality as part of an enterprisewide data management methodology government budget and accounting information policy and practice in taiwan the principal government budget and accounting information policies in taiwan are founded on the ability to provide integrated consistent and timely information for government managers to make more rational decisions concerning national resource allocation and evaluation a specific accounting organization system has been designed for this purpose this paper analyzes information policies and practices according to the relevant laws and regulations identifies issues regarding the policies and presents strategies to resolve the issues enlisting online residents expanding the boundaries of egovernment in a japanese rural township the purpose of this article is to analyze and learn from an unusual way in which local bureaucrats in a japanese rural township are using the internet to serve their constituents by enlisting the support of online residents successful egovernment requires not only rethinking the potential uses of computer technology but in adopting new patterns of decisionmaking power sharing and office management that many bureaucrats may not be predisposed to make the main thesis of this article is that necessity and practicality can play a powerful motivational role in facilitating the incorporation of information technology it at the level of local government this case study of how bureaucrats in towacho a small agricultural town in northeastern japan have harnessed the internet demonstrates clearly the fundamentals of building a successful egovernment framework in this rural municipality similar to many communities in europe and north america today erp systems implementation best practices in canadian government organizations erp enterprise resource planning systems implementation is a complex exercise in organizational innovation and change management government organizations are increasing their adoption of these systems for various benefits such as integrated realtime information better administration and resultbased management government organizations due to their social obligations higher legislative and public accountability and unique culture face many specific challenges in the transition to enterprise systems this motivated the authors to explore the key considerations and typical activities in government organizations adopting erp systems the article adopts the innovation process theory framework as well as the markus  tanis 2000 model as a basis to delineate the erp adoption process although each adopting organization has a distinct set of objectives for its systems the study found many similarities in motivations concerns and strategies across organizations subject access to government documents in an era of globalization intellectual bundling of entities affected by the decisions of supranational organizations as a result of the growing influence of supranational organizations there is a need for a new model for subject access to government information in academic libraries rulings made by supranational bodies such as the world trade organization wto and rulings determined under the auspices of transnational economic agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta often supersede existing law resulting in obligatory changes to national provincial state and municipal legislation just as important is the relationship among private sector companies third party actors such as nongovernmental organizations ngos and governments the interaction among the various entities affected by supranational rulings could potentially form the basis of a new model for subject access to government information work in progress developing policies for access to government information in the new south africa following south africas transition to democracy in 1994 the sa government has adopted policies supporting freedom of expression and freedom of access to information the bill of rights in the new constitution includes a constitutional right of access to information held by the state since 1994 various initiatives have been taken by government and other bodies to promote such access these include moves to reorganize government printing and publishing restructure the governments public information services make government information available on the internet and extend telephony and internet access to poor communities sas new legal deposit act 1997 makes provision for the creation of official publications depositories the promotion of access to information act 2000 was enacted to ensure access to information held by the state and public bodies however despite much activity it has proved difficult to translate principles into practical and wellcoordinated measures to improve access to government information a specific concern is the failure of policymakers to visualize a role for libraries construction of double sampling scontrol charts for agile manufacturing double sampling ds xcontrol charts are designed to allow quick detection of a small shift of process mean and provides a quick response in an agile manufacturing environment however the ds xcontrol charts assume that the process standard deviation remains unchanged throughout the entire course of the statistical process control therefore a complementary ds chart that can be used to monitor the process variation caused by changes in process standard deviation should be developed in this paper the development of the ds scharts for quickly detecting small shift in process standard deviation for agile manufacturing is presented the construction of the ds scharts is based on the same concepts in constructing the ds xcharts and is formulated as an optimization problem and solved with a genetic algorithm the efficiency of the ds scontrol chart is compared with that of the traditional scontrol chart the results show that the ds scontrol charts can be a more economically preferable alternative in detecting small shifts than traditional scontrol charts computer program for calculating the pvalue in testing process capability index csub pmk many process capability indices including csub p csub pk and csub pm have been proposed to provide numerical measures on the process potential and performance combining the advantages of these indices pearn et al 1992 introduced a new capability index called csub pmk which has been shown to be a useful capability index for processes with twosided specification limits in this paper the authors implement the theory of a testing hypothesis using the natural estimator of csub pmk and provide an efficient maple computer program to calculate the pvalues they also provide tables of the critical values for some commonly used capability requirements based on the test they develop a simple stepbystep procedure for inplant applications the practitioners can use the proposed procedure to determine whether their process meets the preset capability requirement and make reliable decisions swamped by data storage while the cost of storage has plummeted the demand continued to

satellite drops  part i concept design and model introduces an innovative microinjector design featuring a bubble valve which entails superior droplet ejection characteristics and monolithic fabrication which allows handling of a wide range of liquids this new microinjector uses asymmetric bubbles to reduce crosstalk increase frequency response and eliminate satellite droplets during a firing ie droplet ejection the virtual valve closes by growing a thermal bubble in the microchannel to isolate the microchamber from the liquid supply and neighboring chambers between firings however the virtual valve opens by collapsing the bubble to reduce flow restriction for fast refilling of the microchamber the use of bubble valves brings about fast and reliable device operation without imposing the significant complication fabrication of physical microvalves would call for in addition through a special heater configuration and chamber designs bubbles surrounding the nozzle cut off the tail of the droplets being ejected and completely eliminate satellite droplets a simple onedimensional model of the operation of the microinjector is used to estimate the bubble formation and

disconnect continues digital content providers the relationships between the people who buy digital content and those who sell it are probably more acrimonious than ever before says dick curtis a director and lead analyst for the research firm outsell inc where he covers econtent contract and negotiation strategies several buyers agree with his observation they cite aggressive sales tactics an unwillingness to deliver content in formats buyers need a reluctance to provide licensing terms that take into account the structure of todays corporations and inadequate service and support as a few of the factors underlying the acrimony still many buyers remain optimistic that compromises can be reached on some of these issues but first they say sellers must truly understand the econtent needs of todays enterprises look into the future of content management predictions of consolidation in the content management cm vendor arena have appeared in nearly every major industry prognosis over the past two years gartner group for example recently reiterated its prediction that half the cm vendors in existence in mid2001 would leave the marketplace by the end of 2002 analysts consistently advise prospective cm buyers to tread carefully because their vendor may not stick around but fortunately the story goes fewer vendor choices will finally bring greater clarity and sharper differentiators to this otherwise very messy product landscape in fact the number of cm vendors continues to rise industry growth has come through greater demand among cm buyers but also expanding product functionality as well as successful partnerships the marketplace certainly cannot sustain its current breadth of vendors in the long run yet it remains unclear when and how any serious industry consolidation will occur in the meantime evolving business models and feature sets have created just the kind of clearer segmentation and transparent product differences that were supposed to emerge following an

popular mechanics trade magazine electronic buyers news and the harvard business review have launched digital versions of their newspapers and magazines to augment their online and print versions the reasons are as varied as the publishers themselves some companies are finding that readers dont like their webbased versions either due to poor navigation or missing graphics and images others want to

syndication technology and service syndication companies are turning themselves into infrastructure companies many syndication companies are now focusing their efforts on enterprise clients instead of the risky dot coms online coverage of the olympic games in 1956 a new medium was evolving which helped shape not only the presentation of the games to a worldwide audience but created entirely new avenues for marketing and sponsorship which changed the entire economic relevance of the games the medium in 1956 was television and the medium now of course is the internet not since 1956 has olympic coverage been so impacted by the onset of new technology as the current olympiad has been but now the ioc finds itself in another set of circumstances not altogether different from 1956 an automated irradiation device for use in cyclotrons two cyclotrons are being operated at ipencnensp one model cv28 capable of accelerating protons with energies up to 24 mev and beam currents up to 30 mu a and three other particles the other one model cyclone 30 accelerates protons with energy of 30 mev and currents up to 350 mu a both have the objective of irradiating targets both for radioisotope production for use in nuclear medicine and general research the development of irradiating systems completely automatized was the objective of this work always aiming to reduce the radiation exposition dose to the workers and to increase the reliability of use of these systems the free lunch is over online content subscriptions on the rise high need rather than high use may be what really determines a users willingness to pay retooling and targeting content may be a sharper strategy than trying to reeducate users that it is time to pay up for material that has been free waiting for a paradigm shift in general user attitudes about paying for online content could be a fools errand cataloguing to help law library users the author takes a broader view of the catalogue than is usual we can include within it items that have locations other than the officelibrary itself this may well start with internet resources but can perfectly appropriately continue with standard works not held in the immediate collection but available in some other accessible collection such as the local reference library the essential feature is to include entries for the kind of material sought by users with the addition of a location mark indicating where they can find it to classify or not to classify that is the question in addressing classification issues the librarian needs to decide what best suits the purpose and requirements of the user group and the organisation they work in the author has used the wellestablished moys classification scheme this gives the level of detail required for current stock and allows for the incorporation of new material as the firms specialisations develop the scheme is widely used in other firms as well as in the local law society library so it will be familiar to many users the role and future of subject classification the exploitation of resources it is imperative that the library information systems lis profession and lis educators appreciate fully the contribution that classification makes to the discipline and that it is no longer seen as the domain of the academic isolated theorist but becomes an integral part of our understanding of the contribution that the lis community can make to society as a whole  as well as to particular areas such as legal information a simple etalonstabilized visible laser diode visible laser diodes lds are inexpensively available with singletransversemode singlelongitudinalmode operation with a coherence length in the metre range with constant current bias and constant operating temperature the optical output power and operating wavelength are stable a simple and inexpensive way is developed to maintain a constant ld temperature as the temperature of the local environment varies by monitoring the initially changing wavelength with an external etalon and using this information to apply a heating correction to the monitor photodiode commonly integral to the ld package the fractional wavelength stability achieved is limited by the solid etalon to 710sup 6 degrees csup 1 experimental investigations on monitoring and control of induction heating process for semisolid alloys using the heating coil as sensor a method of monitoring the state of metal alloys during induction heating and control of the heating process utilizing the heating coil itself as a sensor is proposed and its usefulness and effectiveness were experimentally investigated using aluminium a357 billets for the semisolid metal ssm casting processes the impedance of the coil containing the billet was continuously measured by the proposed method in the temperature range between room temperature and 700 degrees c it was found that the reactance component of the impedance varied distinctively according to the billet state and could clearly monitor the deformation of the billet while the resistance component increased with temperature reflecting the variation of the resistivity of the billet which has strong correlation to the solidliquid fraction of the billets the measured impedance is very sensitive to the billet states such as temperature deformation and solidliquid fraction and could be used as a parameter to monitor and control the heating process for ssms modelling tomographic conebeam projection data from a polyhedral phantom analytical phantoms are used to generate projection data for testing reconstruction accuracy in computed axial tomography a circular source locus equivalent to rotating specimen with a fixed source provides insufficient data for exact reconstruction in conebeam transmission tomography thus phantom data are useful for studying the consequent errors and also for investigating alternative scanning loci and reconstruction techniques we present an algorithm that can compute phantom conebeam projection data from a phantom comprising geometrically defined polyhedra each polyhedron is defined as a set of polygons enclosing a volume of fixed linear attenuation coefficient the algorithm works by projecting each polygon in turn onto the modelled detector array which accumulates the product of source to polygon intersection distance for the rays intersecting each detector element linear attenuation coefficient and sign of projected polygon area indicating whether rays enter or exit the polyhedron at this face the phantom data are rotated according to the projection angle whilst the source location and detector plane remain fixed polyhedra can be of simple geometric form or complex surfaces derived from 3d images of real specimens this algorithm is illustrated using a phantom comprising 989 238 polygons representing an isosurface generated from a microtomographic reconstruction of a piece of walrus tusk improving the frequency stability of microwave oscillators by utilizing the dualmode sapphireloaded cavity resonator the design and experimental testing of a novel control circuit to stabilize the temperature of a sapphireloaded cavity whispering gallery resonatoroscillator and improve its mediumterm frequency stability is presented finiteelement software was used to predict frequencies and quality factors of wgesub 700 and the wghsub 900 modes near 9 ghz and separated in frequency by approximately 80 mhz calculations show that the novel temperature control circuits from the difference frequency can result in a frequency stability of better than one part in 10sup 13 at 270 k also we present details on the best way to couple orthogonally to two modes of similar frequency but different polarization threedimensional particle image tracking for dilute particleliquid flows in a pipe a threedimensional 3d particle image tracking technique was used to study the coarse spherical particleliquid flows in a pipe the flow images from both the front view and the normal side view which was reflected into the front view by a mirror were recorded with a ccd camera and digitized by a pc with an image grabber card an image processing program was developed to enhance and segment the flow image and then to identify the particles over 90 of all the particles can be identified and located from the partially overlapped particle images using the circular hough transform then the 3d position of each detected particle was determined by matching its front view image to its side view image the particle velocity was then obtained by pairing its images in successive video fields the measurements for the spherical expanded polystyrene particleoil flows show that the particles like the spherical bubbles in laminar bubbly flows tend to conglomerate near the pipe wall and to line up to form the particle clusters as liquid velocity decreases the particle clusters disperse and more particles are distributed in the pipe centre region online robust processing techniques for elimination of measurement dropout when processing measurement data it is usually assumed that some amount of normally distributed measurement noise is present in some situations outliers are present in the measurements and consequently the noise is far from normally distributed in this case classical leastsquares procedures for estimating fourier spectra or derived quantities like the frequency response function can give results which are inaccurate or even useless in this paper a novel technique for the online processing of measurement outliers will be proposed both the computation speed and the accuracy of the technique presented will be compared with different classical approaches for handling outliers in measurement data ie filtering techniques outlier rejection techniques and robust regression techniques in particular all processing techniques will be validated by applying them to the problem of speckle dropout in optical vibration measurements performed with a laser doppler vibrometer which typically causes outliers in the measurements development of a 35 inch magnetooptical disk with a capacity of 23 gb the recording capacity of gigamo media was enlarged from 13 gb to 23 gb for 35 inch magnetooptical mo disks while maintaining downward compatibility for the new gigamo technology a land and groove recording method was applied in addition to magnetically induced super resolution msr media furthermore a novel address format suitable for the land and groove recording method was adopted the specifications of the new gigamo media were examined to satisfy requirements for practical use with respect to margins durability of more than 10sup 6 rewritings and an enough lifetime were confirmed application of ultrasonic sensors in the process industry continuous process monitoring in gaseous liquid or molten media is a fundamental requirement for process control besides temperature and pressure other process parameters such as level flow concentration and conversion are of special interest more qualified information obtained from new or better sensors can significantly enhance the process quality and thereby product properties ultrasonic sensors or sensor systems can contribute to this development the state of the art of ultrasonic sensors and their advantages and disadvantages will be discussed commercial examples will be presented among others applications in the food chemical and pharmaceutical industries are described possibilities and limitations of ultrasonic process sensors are discussed handles and exception safety part 1 a simple handle class every c program that uses inheritance must manage memory somehow the most obvious way to do so is directly but programmers who create complicated data structures often have trouble figuring out what parts of those data structures are safe to delete when the classical method of dealing with such complexity is to hide it in a class such classes are typically called handles the idea is to attach a handle object to another object that contains the actual data the simplest form of a handle which we have discussed in this article is one in which each handle object corresponds to a single object from the inheritance hierarchy such handles are straightforward to use and to implement and tend to be intrinsically exception safe in almost all respects the one exception hazard in such a class is typically the assignment operator assignment operators often test for selfassignment to avoid aliasing problems as herb sutter has observed 2000 programs that need such tests are almost always exception unsafe by rewriting the assignment operator we ensure that we do not do anything irrevocable until the possibility of throwing an exception has passed this strategy ensures that if an exception occurs while our assignment operator is executing we do not corrupt the rest of our system using constructed types in c unions the c standard states that a union type cannot have a member with a nontrivial constructor or destructor while at first this seems unreasonable further thought makes it clear why this is the case the crux of the problem is that unions dont have builtin semantics for denoting when a member is the current member of the union therefore the compiler cant know when its appropriate to call constructors or destructors on the union members still there are good reasons for wanting to use constructed object types in a union for example you might want to implement a scripting language with a single variable type that can either be an integer a string or a list a union is the perfect candidate for implementing such a composite type but the restriction on constructed union members may prevent you from using an existing string or list class for example from the stl to provide the underlying functionality luckily a feature of c called placement new can provide a workaround c and c a case for compatibility modern c and c are sibling languages descended from classic c in many peoples minds they are wrongly but understandably fused into the mythical cc programming language there is no cc language but there is a cc community previously the author described some of the incompatibilities that complicate the work of developers within that cc community in this article he discusses some of the underlying myths that help perpetuate these incompatibilities he also shows why more compatibility ideally full compatibility is in the best interest of the cc community in the next paper he presents some examples of how the incompatibilities in c and c might be resolved adaptable dialog boxes for crossplatform programming the author presents a framework for building dialog boxes that adapt to the look and feel of their platform this method also helps with a few related problems specifying crossplatform resources and handling dialog size changes due to localization he uses a combination of xml automatic layout and runtime dialog creation to give you most of the benefits of platformspecific resources without the associated pain source code with an implementation of the layout engine for mac os 91 carbon mac os x and microsoft windows can be downloaded from the cuj website at wwwcujcomcode you can use this code as is or as a starting point for your own more complete implementation applying bgl to computational geometry the author applies boost graph library to the domain of computational geometry first he formulates a concrete problem in graph terms second he develops a way to transform the output of an existing algorithm into an appropriate boost graph library data structure finally he implements two new algorithms for my boost graph library graph the first algorithm gets the job done but could have been written in any programming language the second algorithm however shows the power of boost graph librarys generic programming approachgraphs graphics and generic programming combine in this novel use of the boost graph library the tattletale technique practical experience has taught many java developers one thing critical resources mutexes database connections transactions file handles etc require timely and systematic release unfortunately javas garbage collector is not up to that job according to the java language specification there are no guarantees when a garbage collector will run when it will collect an object or when it will finalize an object  if ever even more unfortunately javas counterpart to the c destructor the finally block is both tedious and errorprone requiring developers to constantly remember and duplicate resourcereleasing code consequently even good java developers can forget to release critical resources there is a light at the end of the tunnel java may make it easier to leak critical resources but it also provides the necessary mechanisms to easily track them down the tattletale technique is a simple method for designing new classes and retrofitting existing classes to quickly and easily detect the offending code responsible for leaking resources international swinging making swing components localesensitive although java and its gui library swing provide software developers with a highly customizable framework for creating truly international applications the swing library is not sensitive to locale switches it cannot automatically change an applications appearance to conform to the conventions of a specific locale at run time several types of applications benefit from the ability to easily switch the language at run time training applications and other programs that run on computers in public spaces such as libraries airports or government offices may need to support multiple languages other applications like travel dictionaries or translation programs are inherently multilingual and are specifically designed to support users of dissimilar tongues such applications would greatly benefit if the userinterface language could be customized at run time the article shows you how to customize swing to support locale switching at run time the author has created a new lookandfeel called the mlmetallookandfeel where ml stands for multilingual this new lookandfeel extends the standard metal lookandfeel but is localesensitive at run time implementing equals for mixedtype comparison the idea of comparing objects of different types is not entirely off base in particular for classes from the same class hierarchy after all objects from the same class hierarchy and by class hierarchy we mean all classes derived from a common superclass other than object have something in common namely at least the superclass part as we demonstrated in a previous paper 2002 providing a correct implementation of a mixedtype comparison is a nontrivial task in this article we will show one way of implementing a mixedtype comparison of objects from the same class hierarchy that meets the requirements of the equals contract raising the standard of management education for electronic commerce professionals the teaching of electronic commerce in universities has become a growth industry in itself the rapid expansion of electronic commerce programmes raises the question of what actually is being taught the association of electronic commerce as primarily a technical or information technology it phenomenon has not been sufficient to constrain it to it and information systems departments business schools have been keen entrants into the electronic commerce coursework race and they are developing electronic commerce programmes in an environment where there is no agreed definition of the term this paper draws on the work of kenneth boulding who argued that the dynamics of change in society are largely a product of changing skills and the way these skills are arranged into roles at the organizational level it is argued that an overly technical interpretation of electronic commerce narrows the skills being acquired as part of formal education universities under pressure from the market and technological change are changing their roles resulting in a further narrowing of the breadth of issues that is seen as legitimate to be included as electronic commerce the outcome is that aspiring electronic commerce professionals are not being exposed to a wide enough agenda of ideas and concepts that will assist them to make better business decisions if the redboot fits opensource rom monitor many embedded developers today use a rom or flashresident software program that provides functionality such as loading and running application software scripting readwrite access to processor registers and memory dumps a rom monitor as it is often called can be a useful and far less expensive debugging tool than an incircuit emulator this article describes the redboot rom monitor it takes a look at the features offered by the redboot rom monitor and sees how it can be configured it also walks through the steps of rebuilding and installing a new redboot image on a target platform finally it looks at future enhancements that are coming in new releases and how to get support and additional information when using redboot although redboot uses software modules from the ecos realtime operating system rtos and is often used in systems running embedded linux it is completely independent of both operating systems redboot can be used with any operating system or rtos or even without one networking in

management system a case analysis this paper discusses the design implementation and evolution of the cornell university library gateway using the case analysis method it diagnoses the gateway within the conceptual framework of definitions and best practices associated with information gateways portals and emerging digital library management systems in particular the product encompass creating webbased listings of electronic journals without creating extra work creating uptodate listings of electronic journals is challenging due to frequent changes in titles available and in urls for electronic journal titles however many library users may want to browse web pages which contain listings of electronic journals arranged by title andor academic disciplines this case study examines the development of a system which automatically exports data from the online catalog and incorporates it into dynamicallygenerated web sites these sites provide multiple access points for journals include webbased interfaces enabling subject specialists to manage the list of titles which appears in their subject area because data are automatically extracted from the catalog overlap in updating titles and urls is avoided following the creation of this system usage of electronic journals dramatically increased and feedback has been positive future challenges include developing more frequent updates and motivating subject specialists to more regularly monitor new titles mobile bankings tough sell banks are having to put their mobilecommerce projects on hold because the essential

timeconsuming process for the customer financial firms hopes for higher mobile usage are stymied by the fact that improvements to the systems wont happen as fast as they want and the inadequacies of

voice recognition voice recognition could be the answer to the problem of financial fraud but in the world of biometric technology money talks a discontinuous galerkin method for transient analysis of wave propagation in unbounded domains a technique based on the discontinuous galerkin finite element method is developed and applied to the derivation of an absorbing boundary condition for the analysis of transient wave propagation the condition is exact in that only discretization error is involved furthermore the computational cost associated with use of the condition is an order of magnitude lower than for conditions based on green functions the timestepping scheme resulting from an implicit method in conjunction with this boundary condition appears to be unconditionally stable direct gear tooth contact analysis for hypoid bevel gears a new methodology for tooth contact analysis based on a very general mathematical model of the generating process is proposed considering the line of action as a first order singularity of a certain operator equation we develop first and second order conditions for a pair of generated gear tooth flanks to be in contact the constructive approach allows the direct computation of the paths of contact as the solution of a nonlinear equation system including the exact determination of the bounds of the paths of contact the transmission error as well as curvature properties in the contact points are obtained in a convenient way the resulting contact ellipses approximate the bearing area through the use of automatic differentiation all the geometric quantities are calculable within the machine accuracy of the computer wave propagation related to highspeed train a scaled boundary feapproach for unbounded domains analysis of wave propagation in solid materials under moving loads is a topic of great interest in railway engineering the objective of the paper is threedimensional modelling of highspeed train related ground vibrations in particular the question of how to account for the unbounded media is addressed for efficient and accurate modelling of railway structural components taking the unbounded media into account a hybrid method based on a combination of the conventional finite element method and scaled boundary finite element method is established in the paper element matrices and solution procedures for the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem are derived a nonlinear finite element iteration scheme using lagrange multipliers and coupling between the unbounded domain and the finite element domain are also discussed two numerical examples including one example demonstrating the dynamical response of a railroad section are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method design patterns for high availability it is possible to achieve fivenines reliability with everyday commercialquality hardware and software the key is the way in which these components are combined the design of high availability systems is based on a combination of redundant hardware components and software to manage fault detection and correction without human intervention the author quickly reviews some definitions tied to high availability and fault management and then goes on to discuss some hardware and software design patterns for fault tolerant systems detection of flaws in composites from scattered elasticwave field using an improved mu ga and a local optimizer an effective technique for flaw detection of composites is proposed in this technique the detection problem is formulated as an optimization problem minimizing the difference between the measured and calculated surface displacement response derived from scattered elasticwave fields a combined optimization technique using an improved mu ga and a local optimizer is developed to solve the optimization problem so as to obtain the flaw parameters defining flaw configurations guidelines for implementing the detection technique including formulation of the objective function of the optimization problem using different error norms improvement of mu ga convergence performance switching from mu ga to local optimizer in the optimization process and suppression of the effect of noise on detection results are addressed in detail numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed detection technique adaptive multiresolution approach for solution of hyperbolic pdes this paper establishes an innovative and efficient multiresolution adaptive approach combined with highresolution methods for the numerical solution of a single or a system of partial differential equations the proposed methodology is unconditionally bounded even for hyperbolic equations and dynamically adapts the grid so that higher spatial resolution is automatically allocated to domain regions where strong gradients are observed thus possessing the two desired properties of a numerical approach stability and accuracy numerical results for five test problems are presented which clearly show the robustness and cost effectiveness of the proposed method nonlinear analysis of nearly saturated porous media theoretical and numerical formulation a formulation for a porous medium saturated with a compressible fluid undergoing large elastic and plastic deformations is presented a consistent thermodynamic formulation is proposed for the twophase mixture problem thus preserving a straightforward and robust numerical scheme a novel feature is the specification of the fluid compressibility in terms of a volumetric logarithmic strain which is energy conjugated to the fluid pressure in the entropy inequality as a result the entropy inequality is used to separate three different mechanisms representing the response effective stress response according to terzaghi in the solid skeleton fluid pressure response to compressibility of the fluid and dissipative darcy flow representing the interaction between the two phases the paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples that display the predictive capabilities of the proposed formulation in particular we consider results for the kinematically linear theory as compared to the kinematically nonlinear theory computational complexity of probabilistic disambiguation recent models of natural language processing employ statistical reasoning for dealing with the ambiguity of formal grammars in this approach statistics concerning the various linguistic phenomena of interest are gathered from actual linguistic data and used to estimate the probabilities of the various entities that are generated by a given grammar eg derivations parsetrees and sentences the extension of grammars with probabilities makes it possible to state ambiguity resolution as a constrained optimization formula which aims at maximizing the probability of some entity that the grammar generates given the input eg maximum probability parsetree given some input sentence the implementation of these optimization formulae in efficient algorithms however does not always proceed smoothly in this paper we address the computational complexity of ambiguity resolution under various kinds of probabilistic models we provide proofs that some frequently occurring problems of ambiguity resolution are npcomplete these problems are encountered in various applications eg language understanding for textand speechbased applications assuming the common model of computation this result implies that for many existing probabilistic models it is not possible to devise tractable algorithms for solving these optimization problems lr parsing for conjunctive grammars the generalized lr parsing algorithm for contextfree grammars introduced by tomita in 1986 is a polynomialtime implementation of nondeterministic lr parsing that uses graphstructured stack to represent the contents of the nondeterministic parsers pushdown for all possible branches of computation at a single computation step it has been specifically developed as a solution for practical parsing tasks arising in computational linguistics and indeed has proved itself to be very suitable for natural language processing conjunctive grammars extend contextfree grammars by allowing the use of an explicit intersection operation within grammar rules this paper develops a new lrstyle parsing algorithm for these grammars which is based on the very same idea of a graphstructured pushdown where the simultaneous existence of several paths in the graph is used to perform the mentioned intersection operation the underlying finite automata are treated in the most general way instead of showing the algorithms correctness for some particular way of constructing automata the paper defines a wide class of automata usable with a given grammar which includes not only the traditional lrk automata but also for instance a trivial automaton with a single reachable state a modification of the slrk table construction method that makes use of specific properties of conjunctive grammars is provided as one possible way of making finite automata to use with the algorithm p systems with symportantiport rules the traces of objects we continue the study of those p systems where the computation is performed by the communication of objects that is systems with symport and antiport rules instead of the number of objects collected in a specified membrane as the result of a computation we consider the itineraries of a certain object through membranes during a halting computation written as a coding of the string of labels of the visited membranes the family of languages generated in this way is investigated with respect to its place in the chomsky hierarchy when the symport and antiport rules are applied in a conditional manner promoted or inhibited by certain objects which should be present in the membrane where a rule is applied then a characterization of recursively enumerable languages is obtained the power of systems with the rules applied freely is only partially described feldkamptype image reconstruction from equiangular data the conebeam approach for image reconstruction attracts increasing attention in various applications especially medical imaging previously the traditional practical conebeam reconstruction method the feldkamp algorithm was generalized into the case of spiralhelical scanning loci with equispatial conebeam projection data in this paper we formulated the generalized feldkamp algorithm in the case of equiangular conebeam projection data and performed numerical simulation to evaluate the image quality because medical multisliceconebeam ct scanners typically use equiangular projection data our new formula may be useful in this area as a framework for further refinement and a benchmark for comparison utilizing webbased case studies for cuttingedge information services issues this article reports on a pilot study conducted by the academic libraries of the 21st century project team to determine whether the benefits of the case study method as a training framework for change initiatives could successfully transfer from the traditional facetoface format to a virtual format methods of developing the training framework as well as the benefits challenges and recommendations for future strategies gained from participant feedback are outlined the results of a survey administered to chat session registrants are presented in three sections 1 evaluation of the training framework 2 evaluation of participants experiences in the virtual environment and 3 a comparison of participants preference of format the overall participant feedback regarding the utilization of the case study method in a virtual environment for professional development and collaborative problem solving is very positive developing webenhanced learning for information fluencya liberal arts colleges perspective learning is likely to take a new form in the twentyfirst century and a transformation is already in process under the framework of information fluency efforts are being made at rollins college to develop a webenhanced course that encompasses information literacy basic computer literacy and critical thinking skills computerbased education can be successful when librarians use technology effectively to enhance their integrated library teaching in an online learning environment students choose a time for learning that best suits their needs and motivational levels they can learn at their own pace take a nonlinear approach to the subject and maintain constant communication with instructors and other students the quality of a technologyfacilitated course can be upheld if the educational objectives and methods for achieving those objectives are carefully planned and explored the necessity of realtimefact and fiction in digital reference systems current discussions and trends in digital reference have emphasized the use of realtime digital reference services recent articles have questioned both the utility and use of asynchronous services such as email this article uses data from the askeric digital reference service to demonstrate that asynchronous services are not only useful and used but may have greater utility than realtime systems embedded linux and the law the rising popularity of linux combined with perceived cost savings has spurred many embedded developers to consider a realtime linux variant as an alternative to a traditional rtos the paper presents the legal implications for the proprietary parts of firmware when reference works are not booksthe new edition of the guide to reference books the author considers the history of the guide to reference books grb and its importance in librarianship he discusses the ways in which the new edition is taking advantage of changing times grb has become a cornerstone of the literature of us librarianship the biggest change grb will undergo to become grs guide to reference sources will be designing it primarily as a web product ecommerceresources for doing business on the internet there are many different types of ecommerce depending upon who or what is selling and who or what is buying in addition ecommerce is more than an exchange of funds and goods or services it encompasses an entire infrastructure of services computer hardware and software products technologies and communications formats the paper discusses ecommerce terminology types and information resources including books and web sites surface textures improve the robustness of stereoscopic depth cues this research develops design recommendations for surface textures patterns of color on object surfaces rendered with stereoscopic displays in 3 methodofadjustment procedure experiments 8 participants matched the disparity of a circular probe and a planar stimulus rendered using a single visible edge the experiments varied stimulus orientation and surface texture participants more accurately matched the depth of vertical stimuli than that of horizontal stimuli consistent with previous studies and existing theory participants matched the depth of surfaces with large pixeltopixel luminance variations more accurately than they did surfaces with a small pixeltopixel luminance variation finally they matched the depth of surfaces with vertical line patterns more accurately than they did surfaces with horizontalstriped texture patterns these results suggest that designers can enhance depth perception in stereoscopic displays and also reduce undesirable sensitivity to orientation by rendering objects with surface textures using large pixeltopixel luminance variations control performance with three translational degrees of freedom for multiple degreeoffreedom dof systems it is important to determine how accurately operators can control each dof and what influence perceptual information processing and psychomotor components have on performance sixteen righthanded male students participated in 2 experiments 1 involving positioning and 1 involving tracking with 3 translational dofs to separate perceptual and psychomotor effects we used 2 controldisplay mappings that differed in the coupling of vertical and depth dimensions to the updown and foreaft control axes we observed information processing effects in the positioning task initial error correction on the vertical dimension lagged in time behind the horizontal dimension the depth dimension error correction lagged behind both which was ascribed to the poorer perceptual information we observed this perceptual effect also in the tracking experiment motor effects were also present with tracking errors along the updown axis of the hand controller being 11 times larger than along the foreaft axis these results indicate that all 3 components contribute to control performance actual applications of this research include interface design contrast sensitivity in a dynamic environment effects of target conditions and visual impairment contrast sensitivity was determined as a function of target velocity 0 degrees 120 degrees s over a variety of viewing conditions in experiment 1 measurements of dynamic contrast sensitivity were determined for observers as a function of target velocity for letter stimuli significant main effects were found for target velocity target size and target duration but significant interactions among the variables indicated especially pronounced adverse effects of increasing target velocity for small targets and brief durations in experiment 2 the effects of simulated cataracts were determined although the simulated impairment had no effect on traditional acuity scores dynamic contrast sensitivity was markedly reduced results are discussed in terms of dynamic contrast sensitivity as a useful composite measure of visual functioning that may provide a better overall picture of an individuals visual functioning than does traditional static acuity dynamic acuity or contrast sensitivity alone the measure of dynamic contrast sensitivity may increase understanding of the practical effects of various conditions such as aging or disease on the visual system or it may allow improved prediction of individuals performance in visually dynamic situations relation between glare and driving performance the present study investigated the effects of discomfort glare on driving behavior participants old and young us and europeans were exposed to a simulated low beam light source mounted on the hood of an instrumented vehicle participants drove at night in actual traffic along a track consisting of urban rural and highway stretches the results show that the relatively low glare source caused a significant drop in detecting simulated pedestrians along the roadside and made participants drive significantly slower on dark and winding roads older participants showed the largest drop in pedestrian detection performance and reduced their driving speed the most the results indicate that the de boer rating scale the most commonly used rating scale for discomfort glare is practically useless as a predictor of driving performance furthermore the maximum us headlamp intensity 1380 cd per headlamp appears to be an acceptable upper limit the perceived utility of human and automated aids in a visual detection task although increases in the use of automation have occurred across society research has found that human operators often underutilize disuse and overly rely on misuse automated aids parasuramanriley 1997 nearly 275 cameron university students participated in 1 of 3 experiments performed to examine the effects of perceived utility dzindolet et al 2001 on automation use in a visual detection task and to compare reliance on automated aids with reliance on humans results revealed a bias for human operators to rely on themselves although selfreport data indicate a bias toward automated aids over human aids performance data revealed that participants were more likely to disuse automated aids than to disuse human aids this discrepancy was accounted for by assuming human operators have a perfect automation schema actual or potential applications of this research include the design of future automated decision aids and training procedures for operators relying on such aids ecological interface design progress and challenges ecological interface design eid is a theoretical framework for designing humancomputer interfaces for complex sociotechnical systems its primary aim is to support knowledge workers in adapting to change and novelty this literature review shows that in situations requiring problem solving eid improves performance when compared with current design approaches in industry eid has been applied to industryscale problems in a broad variety of application domains eg process control aviation computer network management software engineering medicine command and control and information retrieval and has consistently led to the identification of new information requirements

confident use of eid in industry promising paths for addressing these outstanding issues are identified actual or potential applications of this research include improving the safety and productivity of complex sociotechnical systems the effects of work pace on withinparticipant and betweenparticipant keying force electromyography and fatigue a laboratory study was conducted to determine the effects of work pace on typing force electromyographic emg activity and subjective discomfort we found that as participants typed faster their typing force and finger flexor and extensor emg activity increased linearly there was also an increase in subjective discomfort with a sharp threshold between participants selfselected pace and their maximum typing speed the results suggest that participants selfselect a typing pace that maximizes typing speed and minimizes discomfort the fastest typists did not produce significantly more finger flexor emg activity but did produce proportionately less finger extensor emg activity compared with the slower typists we hypothesize that fast typists may use different muscle recruitment patterns that allow them to be more efficient than slower typists at striking the keys in addition faster typists do not experience more discomfort than slow typists these findings show that the relative pace of typing is more important than actual typing speed with regard to discomfort and muscle activity these results suggest that typists may benefit from skill training to increase maximum typing speed potential applications of this research includes skill training for typists agreeing with automated diagnostic aids a study of users concurrence strategies automated diagnostic aids that are less than perfectly reliable often produce unwarranted levels of disuse by operators in the present study users tendencies to either agree or disagree with automated diagnostic aids were examined under conditions in which 1 the aids were less than perfectly reliable but aideddiagnosis was still more accurate that unaided diagnosis and 2 the system was completely opaque affording users no additional information upon which to base a diagnosis the results revealed that some users adopted a strategy of always agreeing with the aids thereby maximizing the number of correct diagnoses made over several trials other users however adopted a probabilitymatching strategy in which agreement and disagreement rates matched the rate of correct and incorrect diagnoses of the aids the probabilitymatching strategy therefore resulted in diagnostic accuracy scores that were lower than was maximally possible users who adopted the maximization strategy had higher selfratings of problemsolving and decisionmaking skills were more accurate in estimating aid reliabilities and were more confident in their diagnosis on trials in which they agreed with the aids the potential applications of these findings include the design of interface and training solutions that facilitate the adoption of the most effective concurrence strategies by users of automated diagnostic aids axioms for branching time logics of general branching time or historical necessity have long been studied but important axiomatization questions remain open here the difficulties of finding axioms for such logics are considered and ideas for solving some of the main open problems are presented a new more expressive logical account is also given to support peirces prohibition on truth values being attached to the contingent future formal verification of humanautomation interaction this paper discusses a formal and rigorous approach to the analysis of operator interaction with machines it addresses the acute problem of detecting design errors in humanmachine interaction and focuses on verifying the correctness of the interaction in complex and automated control systems the paper describes a systematic methodology for evaluating whether the interface provides the necessary information about the machine to enable the operator to perform a specified task successfully and unambiguously it also addresses the adequacy of information provided to the user via training materials eg user manual about the machines behavior the essentials of the methodology which can be automated and applied to the verification of large systems are illustrated by several examples and through a case study of pilot interaction with an autopilot aboard a modern commercial aircraft the expected application of this methodology is an augmentation and enhancement by formal verification of humanautomation interfaces impact of aviation highwayinthesky displays on pilot situation awareness thirtysix pilots 31 men 5 women were tested in a flight simulator on their ability to intercept a pathway depicted on a highwayinthesky hits display while intercepting and flying the pathway pilots were required to watch for traffic outside the cockpit additionally pilots were tested on their awareness of speed altitude and heading during the flight results indicated that the presence of a flight guidance cue significantly improved flight path awareness while intercepting the pathway but significant practice effects suggest that a guidance cue might be unnecessary if pilots are given proper training the amount of time spent looking outside the cockpit while using the hits display was significantly less than when using conventional aircraft instruments additionally awareness of flight information present on the hits display was poor actual or potential applications of this research include guidance for the development of perspective flight display standards and as a basis for flight training requirements a parareal in time procedure for the control of partial differential equations we have proposed in a previous note a time discretization for partial differential evolution equation that allows for parallel implementations this scheme is here reinterpreted as a preconditioning procedure on an algebraic setting of the time discretization this allows for extending the parallel methodology to the problem of optimal control for partial differential equations we report a first numerical implementation that reveals a large interest hypothesisbased concept assignment in software maintenance software maintenance accounts for a significant proportion of the lifetime cost of a software system software comprehension is required in many parts of the maintenance process and is one of the most expensive activities many tools have been developed to help the maintainer reduce the time and cost of this task but of the numerous tools and methods available one group has received relatively little attention those using plausible reasoning to address the concept assignment problem we present a concept assignment method for cobol ii hypothesisbased concept assignment hbca an implementation of a prototype tool is described and results from a comprehensive evaluation using commercial cobol ii sources are summarised in particular we identify areas of a standard maintenance process where such methods would be appropriate and discuss the potential cost savings that may result portfolio optimization and the random magnet problem diversification of an investment into independently fluctuating assets reduces its risk in reality movements of assets are mutually correlated and therefore knowledge of crosscorrelations among asset price movements are of great importance our results support the possibility that the problem of finding an investment in stocks which exposes invested funds to a minimum level of risk is analogous to the problem of finding the magnetization of a random magnet the interactions for this random magnet problem are given by the crosscorrelation matrix c of stock returns we find that random matrix theory allows us to make an estimate for c which outperforms the standard estimate in terms of constructing an investment which carries a minimum level of risk telemedicine in the management of a cervical dislocation by a mobile neurosurgeon neurosurgical teams who are normally located in specialist centres frequently use teleradiology to make a decision about the transfer of a patient to the nearest neurosurgical department this decision depends on the type of pathology the clinical status of the patient and the prognosis if the transfer of the patient is not possible for example because of an unstable clinical status a mobile neurosurgical team may be used we report a case which was dealt with in a remote french military airborne surgical unit in the republic of chad the unit which provides healthcare to the french military personnel stationed there also provides free medical care for the local population it conducts about 100 operations each month the unit comprises two surgeons an orthopaedic and a general surgeon one anaesthetist two anaesthetic nurses one operating room nurse two nurses three paramedics and a secretary the civilian patient presented with unstable cervical trauma a mobile neurosurgeon operated on her and used telemedicine before during and after surgery handheld digital videocamera for eye examination and followup we developed a handheld digital colour videocamera for eye examination in primary care the device weighed 550 g it featured a chargecoupled device ccd and corrective optics both colour video and digital still images could be taken the videocamera was connected to a pc with software for database storage image processing and telecommunication we studied 88 normal subjects 38 male 50 female aged 762 years it was not necessary to use mydriatic eye drops for pupillary dilation satisfactory digital images of the whole face and the anterior eye were obtained the optic disc and the central part of the ocular fundus could also be recorded image quality of the face and the anterior eye were excellent image quality of the optic disc and macula were good enough for teleophthalmology further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of the equipment in different clinical conditions assessment of prehospital chest pain using telecardiology two hundred general practitioners were equipped with a portable electrocardiograph which could transmit a 12lead electrocardiogram ecg via a telephone line a cardiologist was available 24 h a day for an interactive teleconsultation in a 13 month period there were 5073 calls to the telecardiology service and 952 subjects with chest pain were identified the telecardiology service allowed the general practitioners to manage 700 cases 74 themselves further diagnostic tests were requested for 162 patients 17 and 83 patients 9 were sent to the hospital emergency department in the last group a cardiological diagnosis was confirmed in 60 patients and refuted in 23 seven patients in whom the telecardiology service failed to detect a cardiac problem were hospitalized in the subsequent 48 h the telecardiology service showed a sensitivity of 974 a specificity of 895 and a diagnostic accuracy of 869 for chest pain telemedicine could be a useful tool in the diagnosis of chest pain in primary care social presence in telemedicine we studied consultations between a doctor emergency nurse practitioners enps and their patients in a minor accident and treatment service mats in the conventional consultations all three people were located at the main hospital in the teleconsultations the doctor was located in a hospital 6 km away from the mats and used a videoconferencing link connected at 384 kbits there were 30 patients in the conventional group and 30 in the telemedical group the presenting problems were similar in the two groups the mean duration of teleconsultations was 951 s and the mean duration of facetoface consultations was 247 s in doctornurse communication there was a higher rate of turn taking in teleconsultations than in facetoface consultations there were also more interruptions more words and more backchannels eg mhm uhhuh per teleconsultation in doctorpatient communication there was a higher rate of turn taking more words more interruptions and more backchannels per teleconsultation in patientnurse communication there was relatively little difference between the two modes of consulting the doctor telemedicine appeared to empower the patient to ask more questions of the doctor it also seemed that the doctor took greater care in a teleconsultation to achieve coordination of beliefs with the patient than in a facetoface consultation an eightyear study of internetbased remote medical counselling we carried out a prospective study of an internetbased remote counselling service a total of 15456 internet users visited the web site over eight years from these 1500 users were randomly selected for analysis medical counselling had been granted to 901 of the people requesting it 60 one hundred and sixtyfour physicians formed project groups to process the requests and responded using email the distribution of patients using the service was similar to the availability of the internet 78 were from the european union north america and australia sixtyseven per cent of the patients lived in urban areas and the remainder were residents of remote rural areas with limited local medical coverage sixtyfive per cent of the requests were about problems of internal medicine and 30 of the requests concerned surgical issues the remaining 5 of the patients sought information about recent developments such as molecular medicine or aviation medicine during the project our portal became inaccessible five times and counselling was not possible on 44 days there was no hacking of the web site internetbased medical counselling is a helpful addition to conventional practice extending kamps theorem to model time granularity in this paper a generalization of kamps theorem relative to the functional completeness of the until operator is proved such a generalization consists in showing the functional completeness of more expressive temporal operators with respect to the extension of the firstorder theory of linear orders mfo with an extra binary relational symbol the result is motivated by the search of a modal language capable of expressing properties and operators suitable to model time granularity in omega layered temporal structures client satisfaction in a feasibility study comparing facetoface interviews with telepsychiatry we carried out a pilot study comparing satisfaction levels between psychiatric patients seen face to face ftf and those seen via videoconference patients who consented were randomly assigned to one of two groups one group received services in person ftf from the visiting psychiatrist while the other was seen using videoconferencing at 128 kbits one psychiatrist provided all the ftf and videoconferencing assessment and followup visits a total of 24 subjects were recruited three of the subjects 13 did not attend their appointments and two subjects in each group were lost to followup thus there were nine in the ftf group and eight in the videoconferencing group the two groups were similar in most respects patient satisfaction with the services was assessed using the client satisfaction questionnaire csq8 completed four months after the initial consultation the mean scores were 253 in the ftf group and 216 in the videoconferencing group although there was a trend in favour of the ftf service the difference was not significant patient satisfaction is only one component of evaluation the efficacy of telepsychiatry must also be measured relative to that of conventional ftf care before policy makers can decide how extensively telepsychiatry should be implemented evaluation of videoconferenced grand rounds we evaluated various aspects of grand rounds videoconferenced from a tertiary care hospital to a regional hospital in nova scotia during a fivemonth study period 29 rounds were broadcast 19 in medicine and 10 in cardiology the total recorded attendance at the remote site was 103 comprising 70 specialists nine family physicians and 24 other healthcare professionals we received 55 evaluations a response rate of 53 on a fivepoint likert scale on which higher scores indicated better quality mean ratings by remotesite participants of the technical quality of the videoconference were 3035 with the lowest ratings being for ability to hear the discussion 30 and to see visual aids 31 mean ratings for content presentation discussion and educational value were 38 or higher of the 49 physicians who presented the rounds we received evaluations from 41 a response rate of 84 the presenters rated all aspects of the videoconference and interaction with remote sites at 38 or lower the lowest ratings were for ability to see the remote sites 30 and the usefulness of the discussion 34 we received 278 evaluations from participants at the presenting site an estimated response rate of about 55 the results indicated no adverse opinions of the effect of videoconferencing mean scores 3133 the estimated costs of videoconferencing one grand round to one site and four sites were c723 and c1515 respectively the study confirmed that videoconferenced rounds can provide satisfactory continuing medical education to community specialists which is an especially important consideration as maintenance of certification becomes mandatory a systematic review of the efficacy of telemedicine for making diagnostic and management decisions we conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine for making diagnostic and management decisions in three classes of application officehospitalbased storeandforward and homebased telemedicine we searched the medline embase cinahl and healthstar databases and printed resources and interviewed investigators in the field we excluded studies where the service did not historically require facetoface encounters eg radiology or pathology diagnosis a total of 58 articles met the inclusion criteria the articles were summarized and graded for the quality and direction of the evidence there were very few highquality studies the strongest evidence for the efficacy of telemedicine for diagnostic and management decisions came from the specialties of psychiatry and dermatology there was also reasonable evidence that general medical history and physical examinations performed via telemedicine had relatively good sensitivity and specificity other specialties in which some evidence for efficacy existed were cardiology and certain areas of ophthalmology despite the widespread use of telemedicine in most major medical specialties there is strong evidence in only a few of them that the diagnostic and management decisions provided by telemedicine are comparable to facetoface care research into telehealth applications in speechlanguage pathology a literature review was conducted to investigate the extent to which telehealth has been researched within the domain of speechlanguage pathology and the outcomes of this research a total of 13 studies were identified three early studies demonstrated that telehealth was feasible although there was no discussion of the costeffectiveness of this process in terms of patient outcomes the majority of the subsequent studies indicated positive or encouraging outcomes resulting from telehealth however there were a number of shortcomings in the research including a lack of costbenefit information failure to evaluate the technology itself an absence of studies of the educational and informational aspects of telehealth in relation to speechlanguage pathology and the use of telehealth in a limited range of communication disorders future research into the application of telehealth to speechlanguage pathology services must adopt a scientific approach and have a well defined development and evaluation framework that addresses the effectiveness of the technique patient outcomes and satisfaction and the costbenefit relationship where have all the pc makers gone

accessing documents and services on todays web requires human intelligence the interface to these documents and services is the web page written in natural language which humans must understand and act upon the paper discusses the semantic web which will augment the current web with formalized knowledge and data that computers can process in the future some services will mix humanreadable and structured data so that both humans and computers can use them others will support formalized knowledge that only machines will use john mccarthy father of ai if john mccarthy the father of ai were to coin a new phrase for artificial intelligence today he would probably use computational intelligence mccarthy is not just the father of ai he is also the inventor of the lisp list processing language the author considers mccarthys conception of lisp and discusses mccarthys recent research that involves elaboration tolerance creativity by machines free will of machines and some improved ways of doing situation calculus a digitaldriving system for smart vehicles in the wake of the computer and information technology revolutions vehicles are undergoing dramatic changes in their capabilities and how they interact with drivers although some vehicles can decide to either generate warnings for the human driver or control the vehicle autonomously they must usually make these decisions in real time with only incomplete information so human drivers must still maintain control over the vehicle i sketch a digital driving behavior model by simulating and analyzing driver behavior during different maneuvers such as lane changing lane following and traffic avoidance researchers participating in the beijing institute of technologys digitaldriving project will be able to examine the possible correlations or causal relations between the smart vehicle iviss the intelligent roadtrafficinformation network and the driver we aim to successfully demonstrate that a digitaldriving system can provide a direction for developing humancentered smart vehicles optimal and safe ship control as a multistep matrix game the paper describes the process of the safe ship control in a collision situation using a differential game model with j participants as an approximated model of the manoeuvring process a model of a multistep matrix game is adopted here risktraj computer program is designed in the matlab language in order to determine the ships trajectory as a certain sequence of manoeuvres executed by altering the course and speed in the online navigator decision support system these considerations are illustrated with examples of a computer simulation of the safe ships trajectories in real situation at sea when passing twelve of the encountered objects model checking games for branching time logics this paper defines and examines model checking games for the branching time temporal logic ctl the games employ a technique called focus which enriches sets by picking out one distinguished element this is necessary to avoid ambiguities in the regeneration of temporal operators the correctness of these games is proved and optimizations are considered to obtain model checking games for important fragments of ctl a game based model checking algorithm that matches the known lower and upper complexity bounds is sketched damloil an ontology language for the semantic web by all measures the web is enormous and growing at a staggering rate which has made it increasingly difficultand importantfor both people and programs to have quick and accurate access to web information and services the semantic web offers a solution capturing and exploiting the meaning of terms to transform the web from a platform that focuses on presenting information to a platform that focuses on understanding and reasoning with information to support semantic web development the us defense advanced research projects agency launched the darpa agent markup language daml initiative to fund research in languages tools infrastructure and applications that make web content more accessible and understandable although the us government funds daml several organizationsincluding us and european businesses and universities and international consortia such as the world wide web consortiumhave contributed to work on issues related to damls development and deployment we focus on damls current markup language damloil which is a proposed starting point for the w3cs semantic web activitys ontology web language owl we introduce damloil syntax and usage through a set of examples drawn from a wine knowledge base used to teach novices how to build ontologies computational challenges in cell simulation a software engineering approach molecular biologys advent in the 20th century has exponentially increased our knowledge about the inner workings of life we have dozens of completed genomes and an array of highthroughput methods to characterize gene encodings and gene product operation the question now is how we will assemble the various pieces in other words given sufficient information about a living cells molecular components can we predict its behavior we introduce the major classes of cellular processes relevant to modeling discuss software engineerings role in cell simulation and identify cell simulation requirements our ecell project aims to develop the theories techniques and software platforms necessary for wholecellscale modeling simulation and analysis since the projects launch in 1996 we have built a variety of cell models and we are currently developing new models that vary with respect to species target subsystem and overall scale mining open answers in questionnaire data surveys are important tools for marketing and for managing customer relationships the answers to openended questions in particular often contain valuable information and provide an important basis for business decisions the summaries that human analysts make of these open answers however tend to rely too much on intuition and so arent satisfactorily reliable moreover because the web makes it so easy to take surveys and solicit comments companies are finding themselves inundated with data from questionnaires and other sources handling it all manually would be not only cumbersome but also costly thus devising a computer system that can automatically mine useful information from open answers has become an important issue we have developed a survey analysis system that works on these principles the system mines open answers through two statistical learning techniques rule learning which we call rule analysis and correspondence analysis neural networks for web content filtering with the proliferation of harmful internet content such as pornography violence and hate messages effective contentfiltering systems are essential many webfiltering systems are commercially available and potential users can download trial versions from the internet however the techniques these systems use are insufficiently accurate and do not adapt well to the everchanging web to solve this problem we propose using artificial neural networks to classify web pages during content filtering we focus on blocking pornography because it is among the most prolific and harmful web content however our general framework is adaptable for filtering other objectionable web material designing humancentered distributed information systems many computer systems are designed according to engineering and technology principles and are typically difficult to learn and use the fields of humancomputer interaction interface design and human factors have made significant contributions to ease of use and are primarily concerned with the interfaces between systems and users not with the structures that are often more fundamental for designing truly humancentered systems the emerging paradigm of humancentered computing hccwhich has taken many formsoffers a new look at system design hcc requires more than merely designing an artificial agent to supplement a human agent the dynamic interactions in a distributed system composed of human and artificial agentsand the context in which the system is situatedare indispensable factors while we have successfully applied our methodology in designing a prototype of a humancentered intelligent flightsurgeon console at nasa johnson space center this article presents a methodology for designing humancentered computing systems using electronic medical records emr systems modeling and simulating practices a work method for work systems design work systems involve people engaging in activities over timenot just with each other but also with machines tools documents and other artifacts these activities often produce goods services oras is the case in the work system described in this articlescientific data work systems and work practice evolve slowly over time the integration and use of technology the distribution and collocation of people organizational roles and procedures and the facilities where the work occurs largely determine this evolution intelligent control of life support for space missions future manned space operations will include a greater use of automation than we currently see for example semiautonomous robots and software agents will perform difficult tasks while operating unattended most of the time as these automated agents become more prevalent human contact with them will occur more often and become more routine so designing these automated agents according to the principles of humancentered computing is important we describe two cases of semiautonomous control software developed and fielded in test environments at the nasa johnson space center this software operated continuously at the jsc and interacted closely with humans for months at a time ethnography customers and negotiated interactions at the airport in the late 1990s tightly coordinated airline schedules unraveled owing to massive delays resulting from inclement weather overbooked flights and airline operational difficulties as schedules slipped the delayed departures and late arrivals led to systemwide breakdowns customers missed their connections and airline work activities fell further out of sync in offering possible answers we emphasize the need to consider the customer as participant following the humancentered computing model our study applied ethnographic methods to understand the airline system domain and the nature of airline delays and it revealed the deficiencies of the airline production system model of operations the research insights that led us to shift from a production and marketing system perspective to a customerasparticipant view might appear obvious to some readers however we do not know of any airline that designs its operations and technologies around any other model than the production and marketing system view our humancentered analysis used ethnographic methods to gather information offering new insight into airline delays and suggesting effective ways to improve operations reliability rats robots and rescue in early may media inquiries started arriving at my office at the center for robotassisted search and rescue wwwcrasarorg because im crasars director i thought the press was calling to follow up on the recent humanitarian award given to the centers founder john blitch for successfully using small backpackable robots at the world trade center disaster instead i found they were asking me to comment on the roborats study in the 2 may 2002 nature in this study rats with medial force brain implants underwent operant conditioning to force them into a form of guided behavior one aspect of which was thought useful for search and rescue the articles closing comment suggested that a guided rat could serve as both a mobile robot and a biological sensor although a roboticist by training im committed to any technology that will help save lives while reducing the risk to rescuers but rats mathematical modelling of the work of the system of wells in a layer with the exponential law of permeability variation and the mobile liquid interface we construct and study a twodimensional model of the work of the system of wells in a layer with the mobile boundary between liquids of various viscosity we use a plunger displacement model of liquids the boundaries of the filtration region of these liquids are modelled by curves of the lyapunov class unlike familiar work we solve twodimensonal problems in an inhomogeneous layer when the mobile boundary and the boundaries of the filtration region are modelled by curves of the lyapunov class we show the practical convergence of the numerical solution of the problems studied extending ctl with actions and real time in this paper we present the logic atctl which is intended to be used for model checking models that have been specified in a lightweight version of the unified modelling language uml elsewhere we have defined a formal semantics for luml to describe the models this papers goal is to give a specification language for properties that fits luml luml includes states actions and real time atctl extends ctl with concurrent actions and real time it is based on earlier extensions of ctl by r de nicola and f vaandrager actl 1990 and r alur et al tctl 1993 this makes it easier to adapt existing model checkers to atctl to show that we can check properties specified in atctl in models specified in luml we give a small example using the kronos model checker estimation of the gradient of the solution of an adjoint diffusion equation by the monte carlo method for the case of isotropic diffusion we consider the representation of the weighted concentration of trajectories and its space derivatives in the form of integrals with some weights of the solution to the corresponding boundary value problem and its directional derivative of a convective velocity if the convective velocity at the domain boundary is degenerate and some other additional conditions are imposed this representation allows us to construct an efficient random walk by spheres and balls algorithm when these conditions are violated transition to modelling the diffusion trajectories by the euler scheme is realized and the directional derivative of velocity is estimated by the dependent testing method using the parallel modelling of two closelyspaced diffusion trajectories we succeeded in justifying this method by statistically equivalent transition to modelling a single trajectory after the first step in the euler scheme using a suitable weight this weight also admits direct differentiation with respect to the initial coordinate along a given direction the resulting weight algorithm for calculating concentration derivatives is especially efficient if the initial point is in the subdomain in which the coefficients of the diffusion equation are constant efficient algorithms for stiff elliptic problems with large parameters we consider a finite element approximation and iteration algorithms for solving stiff elliptic boundary value problems with large parameters in front of a higher derivative the convergence rate of the algorithms is independent of the spread in coefficients and a discretization parameter mathematical aspects of computeraided share trading we consider problems of statistical analysis of share prices and propose probabilistic characteristics to describe the price series we discuss three methods of mathematical modelling of price series with given probabilistic characteristics solution of the reconstruction problem of a source function in the coagulationfragmentation equation we study the problem of reconstructing a source function in the kinetic coagulationfragmentation equation the study is based on optimal control methods the solvability theory of operator equations and the use of iteration algorithms universal parametrization in constructing smoothlyconnected bspline surfaces in this paper we explore the feasibility of universal parametrization in generating bspline surfaces which was proposed recently in the literature lim 1999 we present an interesting property of the new parametrization that it guarantees go continuity on bspline surfaces when several independently constructed patches are put together without imposing any constraints also a simple blending method of patchwork is proposed to construct csup n1 surfaces where overlapping control nets are utilized it takes into account the semilocalness property of universal parametrization it effectively helps us construct very natural looking bspline surfaces while keeping the deviation from given data points very low experimental results are shown with several sets of surface data points pbezier curves spirals and sectrix curves we elucidate the connection between bezier curves in polar coordinates also called pbezier or focal bezier curves and certain families of spirals and sectrix curves pbezier curves are the analogue in polar coordinates of nonparametric bezier curves in cartesian coordinates such curves form a subset of rational bezier curves characterized by control points on radial directions regularly spaced with respect to the polar angle and weights equal to the inverse of the polar radius we show that this subset encompasses several classical sectrix curves which solve geometrically the problem of dividing an angle into equal spans and also spirals defining the trajectories of particles in central fields first we identify as pbezier curves a family of sinusoidal spirals that includes tschirnhausens cubic second the trisectrix of maclaurin and their generalizations called arachnidas finally a special class of epi spirals that encompasses the trisectrix of delanges using duality to implicitize and find cusps and inflection points of bezier curves a planar algebraic curve c has an implicit equation and a tangential equation the tangential equation defines a dual curve to c starting with a parametrization of c we find a parametrization of the dual curve and the tangential equation and implicit equation of c in a novel way we also find equations whose roots are the parameter values of the cusps and inflection points of c methods include polar reciprocation and the theory of envelopes minimizing blossoms under symmetric linear constraints in this paper we show that there exists a close dependence between the control polygon of a polynomial and the minimum of its blossom under symmetric linear constraints we consider a given minimization problem p for which a unique solution will be a point delta on the bezier curve for the minimization function f two sufficient conditions exist that ensure the uniqueness of the solution namely the concavity of the control polygon of the polynomial and the characteristics of the polya frequencycontrol polygon where the minimum coincides with a critical point of the polynomial the use of the blossoming theory provides us with a useful geometrical interpretation of the minimization problem in addition this minimization approach leads us to a new method of discovering inequalities about the elementary symmetric polynomials explicit matrix representation for nurbs curves and surfaces the matrix forms for curves and surfaces were largely promoted in cadcam in this paper we have presented two matrix representation formulations for arbitrary degree nurbs curves and surfaces explicitly other than recursively the two approaches are derived from the computation of divided difference and the marsden identity respectively the explicit coefficient matrix of bspline with equally spaced knot and bezier curves and surfaces can be obtained by these formulae the coefficient formulae and the coefficient matrix formulae developed in this paper express nonuniform bspline functions of arbitrary degree in explicit polynomial and matrix forms they are useful for the evaluation and the conversion of nurbs curves and surfaces in cadcam systems structural invariance of spatial pythagorean hodographs the structural invariance of the fourpolynomial characterization for threedimensional pythagorean hodographs introduced by dietz et al 1993 under arbitrary spatial rotations is demonstrated the proof relies on a factoredquaternion representation for pythagorean hodographs in threedimensional euclidean spacea particular instance of the ph representation map proposed by choi et al 2002and the unit quaternion description of spatial rotations this approach furnishes a remarkably simple derivation for the polynomials ut upsilon t pt qt that specify the canonical form of a rotated pythagorean hodograph in terms of the original polynomials ut upsilon t pt qt and the angle theta and axis n of the spatial rotation the preservation of the canonical form of ph space curves under arbitrary spatial rotations is essential to their incorporation into computeraided design and manufacturing applications such as the contour machining of freeform surfaces using a ballend mill and realtime ph curve cnc interpolators linear tense logics of increasing sets we provide an extension of the language of linear tense logic with future and past connectives f and p respectively by a modality that quantifies over the points of some set which is assumed to increase in the course of time in this way we obtain a general framework for modelling growth qualitatively we develop an appropriate logical system prove a corresponding completeness and decidability result and discuss the various kinds of flow of time in the new context we also consider decreasing sets briefly uniform hyperbolic polynomial bspline curves this paper presents a new kind of uniform splines called hyperbolic polynomial bsplines generated over the space omega spansinh t cosh t tsup k3 tsup k3 tsup k4  t 1 in which k is an arbitrary integer larger than or equal to 3 hyperbolic polynomial bsplines share most of the properties of bsplines in polynomial space we give subdivision formulae for this new kind of curve and then prove that they have variation diminishing properties and the control polygons of the subdivisions converge hyperbolic polynomial bsplines can handle freeform curves as well as remarkable curves such as the hyperbola and the catenary the generation of tensor product surfaces using these new splines is straightforward examples of such tensor product surfaces the saddle surface the catenary cylinder and a certain kind of ruled surface are given optimal multidegree reduction of bezier curves with constraints of endpoints continuity given a bezier curve of degree n the problem of optimal multidegree reduction degree reduction of more than one degree by a bezier curve of degree m mn1 with constraints of endpoint continuity is investigated with respect to lsub 2 norm this paper presents an approximate method mdr by lsub 2 that gives an explicit solution to deal with it the method has good properties of endpoint interpolation continuity of any r s r sor0 orders can be preserved at two endpoints respectively the method in the paper performs multidegree reduction at one time and does not need stepwise computing when applied to multidegree reduction with endpoint continuity of any order the mdr by lsub 2 obtains the best least squares approximation comparison with another method of multidegree reduction mdr by lsub infinity  which achieves the nearly best uniform approximation with respect to lsub infinity  norm is also given the approximate effect of the mdr by lsub 2 is better than that of the mdr by lsub infinity  explicit approximate error analysis of the multidegree reduction methods is presented waltzing through port 80 web security web services follow the trusting model of the internet but allow ever more powerful payloads to travel between businesses and consumers before you leap online the author advises to scan the security concerns and the available fixes he looks at how we define and store web services and incorporate them into business processes process specialization defining specialization for state diagrams a precise definition of specialization and inheritance promises to be as useful in organizational process modeling as it is in object modeling it would help us better understand maintain reuse and generate process models however even though objectoriented analysis and design methodologies take full advantage of the object specialization hierarchy the process specialization hierarchy is not supported in major process representations such as the state diagram data flow diagram and uml representations partly underlying this lack of support is an implicit assumption that we can always specialize a process by treating it as just another object we argue in this paper that this is not so straightforward as it might seem we argue that a processspecific approach must be developed we propose such an approach in the form of a set of transformations which when applied to a process description always result in specialization we illustrate this approach by applying it to the state diagram representation and demonstrate that this approach to process specialization is not only theoretically possible but shows promise as a method for categorizing and analyzing processes we point out apparent inconsistencies between our notion of process specialization and existing work on object specialization but show that these inconsistencies are superficial and that the definition we provide is compatible with the traditional notion of specialization organizational design information transfer and the acquisition of rentproducing resources within the resourcebased view of the firm a dynamic story has emerged in which the knowledge accumulated over the history of a firm and embedded in organizational routines and structures influences the firms ability to recognize the value of new resources and capabilities this paper explores the possibility of firms to select organizational designs that increase the likelihood that they will recognize and value rentproducing resources and capabilities a computational model is developed to study the tension between an organizations desire to explore its environment for new capabilities and the organizations need to exploit existing capabilities support is provided for the proposition that integration both externally and internally is an important source of dynamic capability the model provides greater insight into the tradeoffs between these two forms of integration and suggests when one form may be preferred over another in particular evidence is provided that in uncertain environments the ability to explore possible alternatives is critical while in more certain environments the ability to transfer information internally is paramount dependence graphs dependence within and between groups this paper applies the twoparty dependence theory castelfranchi cesta and miceli 1992 in y demazeau and e werner eds decentralized ai3 elsevier north holland to modelling multiagent and group dependence these have theoretical potentialities for the study of emerging groups and collective structures and more generally for understanding social and organisational complexity and practical utility for both socialorganisational and agent systems purposes in the paper the dependence theory is extended to describe multiagent links with a special reference to group and collective phenomena and is proposed as a framework for the study of emerging social structures such as groups and collectives in order to do so we propose to extend the notion of dependence networks applied to a single agent to dependence graphs applied to an agency in its present version the dependence theory is argued to provide a a theoretical instrument for the study of social complexity and b a computational system for managing the negotiation process in competitive contexts and for monitoring complexity in organisational and other cooperative contexts gkdevs geometric and kinematic devs formalism for simulation modeling of 3dimensional multicomponent systems a combined discretecontinuous simulation methodology based on the devs discrete event system specification formalism is presented in this paper that satisfies the simulation requirements of 3dimensional and dynamic systems with multicomponents we propose a geometric and kinematic devs gkdevs formalism that is able to describe the geometric and kinematic structure of a system and its continuous state dynamics as well as the interaction among the multicomponents to establish one model having dynamic behavior and a particular hierarchical structure the atomic and the coupled model of the conventional devs are merged into one model in the proposed formalism for simulation of the continuous motion of 3d components the sequential state set is partitioned into the discrete and the continuous state set and the rate of change function over the continuous state set is employed although modified from the conventional devs formalism the gkdevs formalism preserves a hierarchical modular modeling fashion and a coupling scheme furthermore for the gkdevs model simulation we propose an abstract simulation algorithm called a gksimulator in which data and control are separated and events are scheduled not globally but hierarchically so that an objectoriented principle is satisfied the proposed gkdevs formalism and the gksimulator algorithm have been applied to the simulation of a flexible manufacturing system consisting of a 2axis lathe a 3axis milling machine and a vehiclemounted robot using devs formalism to operationalize elp models for diagnosis in sachem this paper describes an original approach to discrete event control of continuous processes by means of expert knowledge we present an application of this approach on the sachem diagnosis subsystem the sachem system is a largescale knowledgebased system that aims in helping a set of operators to control the dynamics of complex continuous systems eg blast furnaces the proposed method is based on i the definition of a language facilitating the acquisition and representation of expert knowledge called elp expert language process ii the use of the devs formalism to make elp models operational iii algorithms for exploiting operational models devs simulation of distributed intrusion detection systems an intrusion detection system ids attempts to identify unauthorized use misuse and abuse of computer and network systems as intrusions become more sophisticated dealing with them moves beyond the scope of one ids the need arises for systems to cooperate with one another to manage diverse attacks across networks the feature of recent attacks is that the packet delivery is moderately slow and the attack sources and attack targets are distributed these attacks are called stealthy attacks to detect these attacks the deployment of distributed idss is needed in such an environment the ability of an ids to share advanced information about these attacks is especially important in this research the ids model exploits blacklist facts to detect the attacks that are based on either slow or highly distributed packets to maintain the valid blacklist facts in the knowledge base of each ids the model should communicate with the other idss when attack level goes beyond the interaction threshold id agents send interaction messages to id agents in other hosts each agent model is developed as an interruptible atomicexpert model in which the expert system is embedded as a model component quantizedstate systems a devsapproach for continuous system simulation a new class of dynamical systems quantized state systems or qss is introduced in this paper qss are continuous time systems where the input trajectories are piecewise constant functions and the state variable trajectories  being themselves piecewise linear functions  are converted into piecewise constant functions via a quantization function equipped with hysteresis it is shown that qss can be exactly represented and simulated by a discrete event model within the framework of the devsapproach further it is shown that qss can be used to approximate continuous systems thus allowing their discreteevent simulation in opposition to the classical discretetime simulation it is also shown that in an approximating qss some stability properties of the original system are conserved and the solutions of the qss go to the solutions of the original system when the quantization goes to zero on the relationship between omega automata and temporal logic normal forms we consider the relationship between omega automata and a specific logical formulation based on a normal form for temporal logic formulae while this normal form was developed for use with execution and clausal resolution in temporal logics we show how it can represent syntactically omega automata in a highlevel way technical proofs of the correctness of this representation are given uniform supersaturated design and its construction supersaturated designs are factorial designs in which the number of main effects is greater than the number of experimental runs in this paper a discrete discrepancy is proposed as a measure of uniformity for supersaturated designs and a lower bound of this discrepancy is obtained asa benchmark of design uniformity a construction method for uniform supersaturated designs via resolvable balanced incomplete block designs is also presented along with the investigation of properties of the resulting designs the construction method shows a strong link between these two different kinds of designs average optimization of the approximate solution of operator equations and its application in this paper a definition of the optimization of operator equations in the average case setting is given and the general result about the relevant optimization problem is obtained this result is applied to the optimization of approximate solution of some classes of integral equations dedekind zetafunctions and dedekind sums in this paper we use dedekind zeta functions of two real quadratic number fields at 1 to denote dedekind sums of high rank our formula is different

vol124 2002 this is the second part of a twopart paper presenting a new methodology for analytically simulating multiaxis machining of complex sculptured surfaces the first section of this paper offers a detailed explanation of the model calibration procedure a new methodology is presented for accurately determining the cutting force coefficients for multiaxis machining the force model presented in part 1 is reformulated so that the cutting force coefficients account for the effects of feed rate cutting speed and a complex cutting edge design experimental results are presented for the calibration procedure model verification tests were conducted with these cutting force coefficients these tests demonstrate that the predicted forces are within 5 of experimentally measured forces simulated results are also shown for predicting dynamic cutting forces and staticdynamic tool deflection the second section of the paper discusses how the modeling methodology can be applied for feed rate scheduling in an industrial application a case study for process optimization of machining an airfoillike surface is used for demonstration based on the predicted instantaneous chip load andor a specified force constraint the feed rate scheduling is utilized to increase the metal removal rate the feed rate scheduling implementation results in a 30 reduction in machining time for the airfoillike surface generic simulation approach for multiaxis machining part 1 modeling methodology this paper presents a new methodology for analytically simulating multiaxis machining of complex sculptured surfaces a generalized approach is developed for representing an arbitrary cutting edge design and the local surface topology of a complex sculptured surface a nurbs curve is used to represent the cutting edge profile this approach offers the advantages of representing any arbitrary cutting edge design in a generic way as well as providing standardized techniques for manipulating the location and orientation of the cutting edge the local surface topology of the part is defined as those surfaces generated by previous tool paths in the vicinity of the current tool position the local surface topology of the part is represented without using a computationally expensive cad system a systematic prediction technique is then developed to determine the instantaneous toolpart interaction during machining the methodology employed here determines the cutting edge incut segments by determining the intersection between the nurbs curve representation of the cutting edge and the defined local surface topology these incut segments are then utilized for predicting instantaneous chip load static and dynamic cutting forces and tool deflection part 1 of this paper details the modeling methodology and demonstrates the capabilities of the simulation for machining a complex surface hot controllers over the last few years the semiconductor industry has put much emphasis on ways to improve the accuracy of thermal mass flow controllers tmfcs although issues involving tmfc mounting orientation and pressure effects have received much attention little has been done to address the effect of changes in ambient temperature or process gas temperature scientists and engineers at qualiflow have succeeded to solve the problem using a temperature correction algorithm for digital tmfcs using an in situ environmental temperature compensation technique we calculated correction factors for the temperature effect and obtained satisfactory results with both the traditional sensor and the new improved thinfilm sensors connection management for qos service on the web the current web service model treats all requests equivalently both while being processed by servers and while being transmitted over the network for some uses such as multiple priority schemes different levels of service are desirable we propose applicationlevel tcp connection management mechanisms for web servers to provide two different levels of web service high and low service by setting different timeouts for inactive tcp connections we evaluated the performance of the mechanism under heavy and light loading conditions on the web server our experiments show that though heavy traffic saturates the network high level class performance is improved by as much as 2528 therefore this mechanism can effectively provide qos guaranteed services even in the absence of operating system and network supports technology on social issues of videoconferencing on the internet a survey constant advances in audiovideo compression the development of the multicast protocol as well as fast improvement in computing devices eg higher speed larger memory have set forth the opportunity to have resource demanding videoconferencing vc sessions on the internet multicast is supported by the multicast backbone mbone which is a special portion of the internet where this protocol is being deployed mbone vc tools are steadily emerging and the user population is growing fast vc is a fascinating application that has the potential to greatly impact the way we remotely communicate and work yet the adoption of vc is not as fast as one could have predicted hence it is important to examine the factors that affect a widespread adoption of vc this paper examines the enabling technology and the social issues it discusses the achievements and identifies the future challenges it suggests an integration of many emerging multimedia tools into vc in order to enhance its versatility for more effectiveness a heuristic approach to resource locations in broadband networks in broadband networks such as atm the importance of dynamic migration of data resources is increasing because of its potential to improve performance especially for transaction processing in environments with migratory data resources it is necessary to have mechanisms to manage the locations of each data resource in this paper we present an algorithm that makes use of system state information and heuristics to manage locations of data resources in a distributed network in the proposed algorithm each site maintains information about state of other sites with respect to each data resource of the system and uses it to find 1 a subset of sites likely to have the requested data resource and 2 the site where the data resource is to be migrated from the current site the proposed algorithm enhances its effectiveness by continuously updating system state information stored at each site it focuses on reducing the overall average time delay needed by the transaction requests to locate and access the migratory data resources we evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm and also compared it with one of the existing location management algorithms by simulation studies under several system parameters such as the frequency of requests generation frequency of data resource migrations network topology and scale of network the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in all cases comments on some recent methods for the simultaneous determination of polynomial zeros in this note we give some comments on the recent results concerning a simultaneous method of the fourthorder for finding complex zeros in circular interval arithmetic the main discussion is directed to a rediscovered iterative formula and its modification presented recently in sun and kosmol 2001 the presented comments include some critical parts of the papers petkovic trickovic herceg 1998 and sun and kosmol 2001 which treat the same subject verifying concurrent systems with symbolic execution current techniques for interactively proving temporal properties of concurrent systems translate transition systems into temporal formulas by introducing program counter variables proofs are not intuitive because control flow is not explicitly considered for sequential programs symbolic execution is a very intuitive interactive proof strategy in this paper we adopt this technique for parallel programs properties are formulated in interval temporal logic an implementation in the interactive theorem prover kiv has shown that this technique offers a high degree of automation and allows simple local invariants adaptive thinning for bivariate scattered data this paper studies adaptive thinning strategies for approximating a large set of scattered data by piecewise linear functions over triangulated subsets our strategies depend on both the locations of the data points in the plane and the values of the sampled function at these points  adaptive thinning all our thinning strategies remove data points one by one so as to minimize an estimate of the error that results by the removal of a point from the current set of points this estimate is termed anticipated error the thinning process generates subsets of most significant points such that the piecewise linear interpolants over the delaunay triangulations of these subsets approximate progressively the function values sampled at the original scattered points and such that the approximation errors are small relative to the number of points in the subsets we design various methods for computing the anticipated error at reasonable cost and compare and test the performance of the methods it is proved that for data sampled from a convex function with the strategy of convex triangulation the actual error is minimized by minimizing the best performing measure of anticipated error it is also shown that for data sampled from certain quadratic polynomials adaptive thinning is equivalent to thinning which depends only on the locations of the data points  nonadaptive thinning based on our numerical tests and comparisons two practical adaptive thinning algorithms are proposed for thinning large data sets one which is more accurate and another which is faster the at89c5152 flash memory programmers when faced with a

principle of optimal control governed by fluid dynamic systems with two point boundary state constraint we study the optimal control problem subject to the semilinear equation with a state constraint we prove certain theorems and give examples of state constraints so that the maximum principle holds the main difficulty of the problem is to make the sensitivity analysis of the state with respect to the control caused by the unboundedness and nonlinearity of an operator necessary conditions of optimality for impulsive systems on banach spaces we present necessary conditions of optimality for optimal control problems arising in systems governed by impulsive evolution equations on banach spaces basic notations and terminologies are first presented and necessary conditions of optimality are presented special cases are discussed and we present an application to the classical linear quadratic regulator problem new projectiontype methods for monotone lcp with finite termination in this paper we establish two new projectiontype methods for the solution of the monotone linear complementarity problem lcp the methods are a combination of the extragradient method and the newton method in which the active set strategy is used and only one linear system of equations with lower dimension is solved at each iteration it is shown that under the assumption of monotonicity these two methods are globally and linearly convergent furthermore under a nondegeneracy condition they have a finite termination property finally the methods are extended to solving the monotone affine variational inequality problem a second order characteristic finite element scheme for convectiondiffusion problems a new characteristic finite element scheme is presented for convectiondiffusion problems it is of second order accuracy in time increment symmetric and unconditionally stable optimal error estimates are proved in the framework of lsup 2theory numerical results are presented for two examples which show the advantage of the scheme riccatibased preconditioner for computing invariant subspaces of large matrices this paper introduces and analyzes the convergence properties of a method that computes an approximation to the invariant subspace associated with a group of eigenvalues of a large not necessarily diagonalizable matrix the method belongs to the family of projection type methods at each step it refines the approximate invariant subspace using a linearized riccatis equation which turns out to be the block analogue of the correction used in the jacobidavidson method the analysis conducted in this paper shows that the method converges at a rate quasiquadratic provided that the approximate invariant subspace is close to the exact one the implementation of the method based on multigrid techniques is also discussed and numerical experiments are reported fuzzy nonhomogeneous markov systems in this paper the theory of fuzzy logic and fuzzy reasoning is combined with the theory of markov systems and the concept of a fuzzy nonhomogeneous markov system is introduced for the first time this is an effort to deal with the uncertainty introduced in the estimation of the transition probabilities and the input probabilities in markov systems the asymptotic behaviour of the fuzzy markov system and its asymptotic variability is considered and given in closed analytic form moreover the asymptotically attainable structures of the system are estimated also in a closed analytic form under some realistic assumptions the importance of this result lies in the fact that in most cases the traditional methods for estimating the probabilities can not be used due to lack of data and measurement errors the introduction of fuzzy logic into markov systems represents a powerful tool for taking advantage of the symbolic knowledge that the experts of the systems possess on the convergence of the bermudezmoreno algorithm with constant parameters a bermudez and c moreno 1981 presented a duality numerical algorithm for solving variational inequalities of the second kind the performance of this algorithm strongly depends on the choice of two constant parameters assuming a further hypothesis of the infsup type we present here a convergence theorem that improves on the one presented by a bermudez and c moreno we prove that the convergence is linear and we give the expression of the asymptotic error constant and the explicit form of the optimal parameters as a function of some constants related to the variational inequality finally we present some numerical examples that confirm the theoretical results the numerical solution of an evolution problem of second order in time on a closed smooth boundary we consider an initial value problem for the secondorder differential equation with a dirichlettoneumann operator coefficient for the numerical solution we carry out semidiscretization by the laguerre transformation with respect to the time variable then an infinite system of the stationary operator equations is obtained by potential theory the operator equations are reduced to boundary integral equations of the second kind with logarithmic or hypersingular kernels the full discretization is realized by nystroms method which is based on the trigonometric quadrature rules numerical tests confirm the ability of the method to solve these types of nonstationary problems stability of rungekutta methods for delay integrodifferential equations we study stability of rungekutta rk methods for delay integrodifferential equations with a constant delay on the basis of the linear equation dudt  lut  mut tau   k integral sub t tau sup t u theta d theta  where l m k are constant complex matrices in particular we show that the same result as in the case k  0 koto 1994 holds for this test equation ie every astable rk method preserves the delayindependent stability of the exact solution whenever a stepsize of the form h  tau m is used where m is a positive integer numerical solution of forward and backward problem for 2d heat conduction equation for a twodimensional heat conduction problem we consider its initial boundary value problem and the related inverse problem of determining the initial temperature distribution from transient temperature measurements the conditional stability for this inverse problem and the error analysis for the tikhonov regularization are presented an implicit inversion method which is based on the regularization technique and the successive overrelaxation sor iteration process is established due to the explicit difference scheme for a direct heat problem developed in this paper the inversion process is very efficient while the application of sor technique makes our inversion convergent rapidly numerical results illustrating our method are also given differential calculus for pnorms of complexvalued vector functions with applications for complexvalued ndimensional vector functions t to st supposed to be sufficiently smooth the differentiability properties of the mapping t to stsub p at every point t  tsub 0 epsilon rsub 0sup  t epsilon r  t or 0 are investigated where   sub p is the usual vector norm in csup n resp rsup n for p epsilon 1 o infinity  moreover formulae for the first three right derivatives dsub sup kstsub p k  1 23 are determined these formulae are applied to vibration problems by computing the best upper bounds on stsub p in certain classes of bounds these results cannot be obtained by the methods used so far the systematic use of the differential calculus for vector norms as done here for the first time could lead to major advances also in other branches of mathematics and other sciences a note on multiindex polynomials of dickson type and their applications in quantum optics we discuss the properties of a new family of multiindex lucas type polynomials which are often encountered in problems of intracavity photon statistics we develop an approach based on the integral representation method and show that this class of polynomials can be derived from recently introduced multiindex hermite like polynomials regularity of some

the c 1 means 1n sub m1 sigma sup nssub mf the class of weights wsup 2 considered includes even and noneven exponential weights orthogonality of the jacobi polynomials with negative integer parameters it is well known that the jacobi polynomials psub nsup  alpha  beta x are orthogonal with respect to a quasidefinite linear functional whenever alpha  beta  and alpha  beta  1 are not negative integer numbers recently sobolev orthogonality for these polynomials has been obtained for alpha a negative integer and beta not a negative integer and also for the case alpha  beta negative integer numbers in this paper we give a sobolev orthogonality for the jacobi polynomials in the remainder cases a comparison theorem for the iterative method with the preconditioner i  ssub max ad gunawardena et al 1991 have reported the modified gaussseidel method with a preconditioner i  s in this article we propose to use a preconditioner i  ssub max instead of i  s here ssub max is constructed by only the largest element at each row of the upper triangular part of a by using the lemma established by m neumann and rj plemmons 1987 we get the comparison theorem for the proposed method simple numerical examples are also given using extended logic programming for alarmcorrelation in cellular phone networks alarm correlation is a necessity in large mobile phone networks where the alarm bursts resulting from severe failures would otherwise overload the network operators we describe how to realize alarmcorrelation in cellular phone networks using extended logic programming to this end we describe an algorithm and system solving the problem a model of a mobile phone network application and a detailed solution for a specific scenario determinantal solutions of solvable chaotic systems it is shown that two solvable chaotic systems the arithmeticharmonic mean arm algorithm and the ulamvon neumann uvn map have determinantal solutions an additional formula for certain determinants and riccati difference equations play a key role in both cases two infinite hierarchies of solvable chaotic systems are presented which have determinantal solutions selfvalidating integration and approximation of piecewise analytic functions let an analytic or a piecewise analytic function on a compact interval be given we present algorithms that produce enclosures for the integral or the

and employed to solve the corresponding twodimensional integral equation the solutions of the weakly singular integral equation for 0 alpha 2 and of the hypersingular integral equation for 2 alpha 4 are obtained respectively a distance between elliptical distributions based in an embedding into the siegel group this paper describes two different embeddings of the manifolds corresponding to many elliptical probability distributions with the informative geometry into the manifold of positivedefinite matrices with the siegel metric generalizing a result published previously elsewhere these new general embeddings are applicable to a wide class of elliptical probability distributions in which the normal tstudent and cauchy are specific examples a lower bound for the rao distance is obtained which is itself a distance and through these embeddings a number of statistical tests of hypothesis are derived asymptotic normality for the ksub phi divergence goodnessoffit tests in this paper for a wide class of goodnessoffit statistics based ksub phi divergences the asymptotic normality is established under the assumption nmsub n to a in 0 infinity  where n denotes sample size and msub n the

life modeling a survey of the models that have been developed over the last decade and a half is presented to demonstrate that alife techniques have a lot to offer an explanatory theory of language it is argued that this is because much of the structure of language is determined by the interaction of three complex adaptive systems learning culture and biological evolution computational simulation informed by theoretical linguistics is an appropriate response to the challenge of explaining real linguistic data in terms of the processes that underpin human language an interactive selfreplicator implemented in hardware selfreplicating loops presented to date are essentially worlds unto themselves inaccessible to the observer once the replication process is launched we present the design of an interactive selfreplicating loop of arbitrary size wherein the user can physically control the loops replication and induce its destruction after introducing the biowall a reconfigurable electronic wall for bioinspired applications we describe the design of our novel loop and delineate its hardware implementation in the wall automatic extraction of eye and mouth fields from a face image using eigenfeatures and ensemble networks this paper presents a novel algorithm for the extraction of the eye and mouth facial features fields from 2d gray level images eigenfeatures are derived from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the binary edge data set constructed from eye and mouth fields such eigenfeatures are ideal features for finely locating fields efficiently the eigenfeatures are extracted from a set of the positive and negative training samples for facial features and are used to train a multilayer perceptron mlp whose output indicates the degree to which a particular image window contains the eyes or the mouth within itself an ensemble network consisting of a multitude of independent mlps was used to enhance the generalization performance of a single mlp it was experimentally verified that the proposed algorithm is robust against facial size and even slight variations of the pose selfreproduction in threedimensional reversible cellular space due to inevitable power dissipation it is said that nanoscaled computing devices should perform their computing processes in a reversible manner this will be a large problem in constructing threedimensional nanoscaled functional objects reversible cellular automata rca are used for modeling physical phenomena such as power dissipation by studying the dissipation of garbage signals we construct a threedimensional selfinspective selfreproducing reversible cellular automaton by extending the twodimensional version srsub 8 it can selfreproduce various patterns in threedimensional reversible

ages of gaia oxford university press 1995 from an artificial life perspective downing proceedings of the 7th international conference on artificial life p 9099 mit press 2000 with the aim of assessing the general compatibility of emergent distributed environmental control with conventional natural selection our earlier system guild downing and zvirinsky artificial life 5 p291318 1999 displayed emergent regulation of the chemical environment by a population of metabolizing agents but the chemical model underlying those results was trivial essentially admitting all possible reactions at a single energy cost the new model metamic utilizes abstract chemistries that are both a constrained to a small set of legal reactions and b grounded in basic fundamental relationships between energy entropy and biomass synthesisbreakdown to explore the general phenomena of emergent homeostasis we generate 100 different chemistries and use each as the basis for several metamic runs as part of a gaia hunt this search discovers 20 chemistries that support microbial populations capable of regulating a physical environmental factor within their growthoptimal range despite the extra metabolic cost case studies from the gaia hunt illustrate a few simple mechanisms by which real biota might exploit the underlying chemistry to achieve some control over their physical environment although these results shed little light on the question of gaia on earth they support the possibility of emergent environmental control at the microcosmic level ant colony optimization and stochastic gradient descent we study the relationship between the two techniques known as ant colony optimization aco and stochastic gradient descent more precisely we show that some empirical aco algorithms approximate stochastic gradient descent in the space of pheromones and we propose an implementation of stochastic gradient descent that belongs to the family of aco algorithms we then use this insight to explore the mutual contributions of the two techniques nogo areas content management alex fry looks at how content management systems can be used to ensure website access for one important customer group the disabled records role in ebusiness records management standards are now playing a key role in ebusiness strategy neural and neurofuzzy integration in a knowledgebased system for air quality prediction we propose a unified approach for integrating implicit and explicit knowledge in neurosymbolic systems as a combination of neural and neurofuzzy modules in the developed hybrid system a training data set is used for building neurofuzzy modules and represents implicit domain knowledge the explicit domain knowledge on the other hand is represented by fuzzy rules which are directly mapped into equivalent neural structures the aim of this approach is to improve the abilities of modular neural structures which are based on incomplete learning data sets since the knowledge acquired from human experts is taken into account for adapting the general neural architecture three methods to combine the explicit and implicit knowledge modules are proposed the techniques used to extract fuzzy rules from neural implicit knowledge modules are described these techniques improve the structure and the behavior of the entire system the proposed methodology has been applied in the field of air quality

is addressed the hodographs of such curves correspond to certain combinations of four polynomials given by dietz et al 1993 that admit compact descriptions in terms of quaternions  an instance of the ph representation map proposed by choi et al 2002 the lowestorder ph curves that interpolate arbitrary firstorder spatial hermite data are quintics it is shown that with ph quintics the quaternion representation yields a reduction of the hermite interpolation problem to three simple quadratic equations in three quaternion unknowns this system admits a closedform solution expressing all ph quintic interpolants to given spatial hermite data as a twoparameter family an integral shape measure is invoked to fix these two free parameters single and multiinterval legendre tau methods in time for parabolic equations in this paper we take the parabolic equation with periodic boundary conditions as a model to present a spectral method with the fourier approximation in spatial and singlemultiinterval legendre petrovgalerkin methods in time for the single interval spectral method in time we obtain the optimal error estimate in lsup 2norm for the multiinterval spectral method in time the lsup 2optimal error estimate is valid in spatial numerical results show the efficiency of the methods training multilayer perceptrons via minimization of sum of ridge functions motivated by the problem of training multilayer perceptrons in neural networks we consider the problem of minimizing ex sigma sub i1sup n fsub i xi sub ix where xi sub i in rsup s 1oriorn and each fsub i xi sub ix is a ridge function we show that when n is small the problem of minimizing e can be treated as one of minimizing univariate functions and we use the gradient algorithms for minimizing e when n is moderately large for a large n we present the online gradient algorithms and especially show the monotonicity and weak convergence of the algorithms convergence of finite element approximations and multilevel linearization for ginzburglandau model of dwave superconductors in this paper we consider the finite element approximations of a recently proposed ginzburglandautype model for dwave superconductors in contrast to the conventional ginzburglandau model the scalar complex valued orderparameter is replaced by a multicomponent complex orderparameter and the free energy is modified according to the dwave paring symmetry convergence and optimal error estimates and some superconvergent estimates for the derivatives are derived furthermore we propose a multilevel linearization procedure to solve the nonlinear systems it is proved that the optimal error estimates and superconvergence for the derivatives are preserved by the multilevel linearization algorithm wavelet collocation methods for a first kind boundary integral equation in acoustic scattering in this paper we consider a wavelet algorithm for the piecewise constant collocation method applied to the boundary element solution of a first kind integral equation arising in acoustic scattering the conventional stiffness matrix is transformed into the corresponding matrix with respect to wavelet bases and it is approximated by a compressed matrix finally the stiffness matrix is multiplied by diagonal preconditioners such that the resulting matrix of the system of linear equations is well conditioned and sparse using this matrix the boundary integral equation can be solved effectively application of heuristic methods for conformance test selection in this paper we focus on the test selection problem it is modeled after a reallife problem that arises in telecommunication when one has to check the reliability of an application we apply different metaheuristics namely reactive tabu search rts genetic algorithms ga and simulated annealing sa to solve the problem we propose some modifications to the conventional schemes including an adaptive neighbourhood sampling in rts an adaptive variable mutation rate in ga and an adaptive variable neighbourhood structure in sa the performance of the algorithms is evaluated in different models for existing protocols computational results show that ga and sa can provide highquality solutions in acceptable time compared to the results of a commercial software which makes them applicable in practical test selection a decision support model for selecting productservice benefit positionings the art and science of successful productservice positioning generally hinges on the firms ability to select a set of attractively priced consumer benefits that are valued by the buyer distinctive in one or more respects believable deliverable and sustainable under actual or potential competitive abilities to imitate neutralize or overcome in the target markets that the firm selects for many years the ubiquitous quadrant chart has been used to provide a simple graph of productservice benefits usually called productservice attributes described in terms of consumers perceptions of the importance of attributes to brandsupplier choice and the performance of competing firms on these attributes this paper describes a model that extends the quadrant chart concept to a decision support system that optimizes a firms market share for a specified productservice in particular we describe a decision support model that utilizes relatively simple marketing research data on consumers judged benefit importances and supplier performances on these benefits to develop message components for specified target buyers a case study is used to illustrate the model the study deals with developing advertising message components for a relatively new entrant in the us air shipping market we also discuss more briefly management reactions to application of the model to date and areas for further research and model extension evaluating the best main battle tank using fuzzy decision theory with linguistic criteria evaluation in this paper experts opinions are described in linguistic terms which can be expressed in trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy numbers to make the consensus of the experts consistent we utilize the fuzzy delphi method to adjust the fuzzy rating of every expert to achieve the consensus condition for the aggregate of many experts opinions we take the operation of fuzzy numbers to get the mean of fuzzy rating xsub ij and the mean of weight wsub j in multialternatives and multiattributes cases the fuzzy decision matrix xxsub ijsub mn is constructed by means of the fuzzy rating xsub ij then we can derive the aggregate fuzzy numbers by multiplying the fuzzy decision matrix with the corresponding fuzzy attribute weights the final results become a problem of ranking fuzzy numbers we also propose an easy procedure of using fuzzy numbers to rank aggregate fuzzy numbers asub i in this way we can obtain the best selection for evaluating the system for practical application we propose an algorithm for evaluating the best main battle tank by fuzzy decision theory and comparing it with other methods dual nature of mass multiagent systems dual nature of mass multiagent systems mmas emerging as an internal discord of two spheres  micro virtual consisting of agents and their internal phenomena and macro arising at the interface to the real world stems the necessity of a new approach to analysis design and utilisation of such systems based on the concept of vr decomposition the problem of management of such systems is discussed as a subtype that makes mmas closer to the application sphere an evolutionary multiagent system emas is proposed emas combines features of mmas with advantages of an evolutionary model of computation as an illustration of this consideration two particular emas are presented which allow us to obtain promising results in the fields of multiobjective optimisation and timeseries prediction and thus justify the approach taming the paper tiger paperwork organization generally acknowledged as a critical problem for many information professionals the massive flow of documents paper trails and information needs efficient and dependable approaches for processing and storing and finding items and information the development and evaluation of a fuzzy logic expert system for renal transplantation assignment is this a useful tool allocating donor kidneys to patients

way to deal with the vagueness and complexity faced by medical doctors in kidney allocation decision making a pilot fuzzy logic expert system for kidney allocation was developed and evaluated in comparison with two existing allocation algorithms a priority sorting system used by multiple organ retrieval and exchange more in canada and a point scoring systems used by united network for organ sharing unos in us our simulated experiment based on real data indicated that the fuzzy logic system can represent the experts thinking well in handling complex tradeoffs and overall the fuzzy logic derived recommendations were more acceptable to the expert than those from the more and unos algorithms solving the multiple competitive facilities location problem in this paper we propose five heuristic procedures for the solution of the multiple competitive facilities location problem a franchise of several facilities is to be located in a trade area where competing facilities already exist the objective is to maximize the market share captured by the franchise as a whole we perform extensive computational tests and conclude that a twostep heuristic procedure combining simulated annealing and an ascent algorithm provides the best solutions an optimization approach to plan for reusable software components it is well acknowledged in software engineering that there is a great potential for accomplishing significant productivity improvements through the implementation of a successful software reuse program on the other hand such gains are attainable only by instituting detailed action plans at both the organizational and program level given this need the paucity of research papers related to planning and in particular optimized planning is surprising this research which is aimed at this gap brings out an application of optimization for the planning of reusable software components scs we present a model that selects a set of scs that must be built in order to lower development and adaptation costs we also provide implications to project management based on simulation an approach that has been adopted by other cost models in the software engineering literature such a prescriptive model does not exist in the literature exploiting structure in adaptive dynamic programming algorithms for a stochastic batch service problem the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using structural results in dynamic programming algorithms we consider the problem of approximating optimal strategies for the batch service of customers at a service station customers stochastically arrive at the station and wait to be served incurring a waiting cost and a service cost service of customers is performed in groups of a fixed service capacity we investigate the structure of cost functions and establish some theoretical results including monotonicity of the value functions then we use our adaptive dynamic programming monotone algorithm that uses structure to preserve monotonicity of the estimates at each iterations to approximate the value functions since the problem with homogeneous customers can be solved optimally we have a means of comparison to evaluate our heuristic finally we compare our algorithm to classical forward dynamic programming methods improving supplychain performance by sharing advance demand information in this paper we analyze how sharing advance demand information adi can improve supplychain performance we consider two types of adi aggregated adi aadi and detailed adi dadi with aadi customers share with manufacturers information about whether they will place an order for some product in the next time period but do not share information about which product they will order and which of several potential manufacturers will receive the order with dadi customers additionally share information about which product they will order but which manufacturer will receive the order remains uncertain we develop and solve mathematical models of supply chains where adi is shared we derive exact expressions and closedform approximations for expected costs expected basestock levels and variations of the production quantities we show that both the manufacturer and the customers benefit from sharing adi but that sharing adi increases the bullwhip effect we also show that under certain conditions it is optimal to collect adi from either none or all of the customers we study two supply chains in detail a supply chain with an arbitrary number of products that have identical demand rates and a supply chain with two products that have arbitrary demand rates for these two supply chains we analyze how the values of aadi and dadi depend on the characteristics of the supply chain and on the quality of the shared information and we identify conditions under which sharing aadi and dadi can significantly reduce cost our results can be used by decision makers to analyze the cost savings that can be achieved by sharing adi and help them to determine if sharing adi is beneficial for their supply chains a grasp heuristic for the mixed chinese postman problem arc routing problems arps consist of finding a traversal on a graph satisfying some conditions related to the links of the graph in the chinese postman problem cpp the aim is to find a minimum cost tour closed walk traversing all the links of the graph at least once both the undirected cpp where all the links are edges that can be traversed in both ways and the directed cpp where all the links are arcs that must be traversed in a specified way are known to be polynomially solvable however if we deal with a mixed graph having edges and arcs the problem turns out to be nphard in this paper we present a heuristic algorithm for this problem the socalled mixed cpp mcpp based on greedy randomized adaptive search procedure grasp techniques the algorithm has been tested and compared with other known and recent methods from the literature on a wide collection of randomly generated instances with up to 200 nodes and 600 links producing encouraging computational results as far as we know this is the best heuristic algorithm for the mcpp with respect to solution quality published up to now single machine earlinesstardiness scheduling with resourcedependent release dates this paper deals with the single machine earliness and tardiness scheduling problem with a common due date and resourcedependent release dates it is assumed that the cost of resource consumption of a job is a nonincreasing linear function of the job release date and this function is common for all jobs the objective is to find a schedule and job release dates that minimize the total resource consumption and earliness and tardiness penalties it is shown that the problem is nphard in the ordinary sense even if the due date is unrestricted the number of jobs that can be scheduled before the due date is unrestricted an exact dynamic programming dp algorithm for small and medium size problems is developed a heuristic algorithm for largescale problems is also proposed and the results of a computational comparison between heuristic and optimal solutions are discussed a solvable queueing network model for railway networks and its validation and applications for the netherlands the performance of new railway networks cannot be measured or simulated as no detailed train schedules are available railway infrastructure and capacities are to be determined long before the actual traffic is known this paper therefore proposes a solvable queueing network model to compute performance measures of interest without requiring train schedules timetables closed form expressions for mean delays are obtained new network designs traffic scenarios and capacity expansions can so be evaluated a comparison with real delay data for the netherlands supports the practical value of the model a special dutch cargoline application is included a geometric process equivalent model for a multistate degenerative system in this paper a monotone process model for a onecomponent degenerative system with k1 states k failure states and one working state is studied we show that this model is equivalent to a geometric process gp model for a twostate one component system such that both systems have the same longrun average cost per unit time and the same optimal policy furthermore an explicit expression for the determination of an optimal policy is derived modeling undesirable factors in efficiency evaluation data envelopment analysis dea measures the relative efficiency of decision making units dmus with multiple performance factors which are grouped into outputs and inputs once the efficient frontier is determined inefficient dmus can improve their performance to reach the efficient frontier by either increasing their current output levels or decreasing their current input levels however both desirable good and undesirable bad factors may be present for example if inefficiency exists in production processes where final products are manufactured with a production of wastes and pollutants the outputs of wastes and pollutants are undesirable and should be reduced to improve the performance using the classification invariance property we show that the standard dea model can be used to improve the performance via increasing the desirable outputs and decreasing the undesirable outputs the method can also be applied to situations when some inputs need to be increased to improve the performance the linearity and convexity of dea are preserved through our proposal electronic books reports of their death have been exaggerated ebooks will survive but not in the consumer market  at least not until reading devices become

piecewiselinear block for neurofuzzy applications a new method to implement an arbitrary piecewiselinear characteristic in current mode is presented each of the breaking points and each slope is separately controllable as an example a block that implements an nshaped piecewiselinearity has been designed the nshaped block operates in the subthreshold region and uses only ten transistors these

adaptive quasinewton algorithm is first developed to extract a single minor component corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of a stationary sample covariance matrix a deflation technique instead of

of the robot the work has confirmed the superiority of the proposed nnbased control system in rejecting large disturbances boolean operators and the naive enduser moving to and since so few endusers make use of boolean searching it is obvious that any effective solution needs to take this reality into account the most important aspect of a technical solution should be that it does not require any effort on the part of users what is clearly needed is for search engine designers and programmers to take account of the informationseeking behavior of internet users users must be able to enter a

for leisure and entertainment development and validation of useradaptive navigation and information retrieval tools for an intranet portal organizational memory information system based on previous research and properties of organizational memory a conceptual model for navigation and retrieval functions in an intranet portal organizational memory information system was proposed and two humancentred features memory structure map and historybased tool were developed to support users navigation and retrieval in a wellknown organizational memory to test two hypotheses concerning the validity of the conceptual model and two humancentred features an experiment was conducted with 30 subjects testing of the two hypotheses indicated the following 1 the memory structure maps users showed 29 better performance in navigation and 2 the historybased tools users outperformed by 34 in identifying information the results of the study suggest that a conceptual model and two humancentred features could be used in a useradaptive interface design to improve users performance in an intranet portal organizational memory information system effectiveness of user testing and heuristic evaluation as a function of performance classification for different levels of user performance different types of information are processed and users will make different types of errors based on the errors immediate cause and the information being processed usability problems can be classified into three categories they are usability problems associated with skillbased rulebased and knowledgebased levels of performance in this paper a user interface for a webbased software program was evaluated with two usability evaluation methods user testing and heuristic evaluation the experiment discovered that the heuristic evaluation with human factor experts is more effective than user testing in identifying usability problems associated with skillbased and rulebased levels of performance user testing is more effective than heuristic evaluation in finding usability problems associated with the knowledgebased level of performance the practical application of this research is also discussed in the paper an experimental evaluation of comprehensibility aspects of knowledge structures derived through induction techniques a case study of industrial fault diagnosis machine induction has been extensively used in order to develop knowledge bases for decision support systems and predictive systems the extent to which developers and domain experts can comprehend these knowledge structures and gain useful insights into the basis of decision making has become a challenging research issue this article examines the knowledge structures generated by the c45 induction technique in a fault diagnostic task and proposes to use a model of human learning in order to guide the process of making comprehensive the results of machine induction the model of learning is used to generate hierarchical representations of diagnostic knowledge by adjusting the level of abstraction and varying the goal structures between shallow and deep ones comprehensibility is assessed in a global way in an experimental comparison where subjects are required to acquire the knowledge structures and transfer to new tasks this method of addressing the issue of comprehensibility appears promising especially for machine induction techniques that are rather inflexible with regard to the number and sorts of interventions allowed to system developers effects of the transition to a clientcentred team organization in administrative surveying work a new work organization was introduced in administrative surveying work in sweden during 1998 the new work organization implied a transition to a clientcentred teambased organization and required a change in competence from specialist to generalist knowledge as well as a transition to a new information technology implying a greater integration within the company the aim of this study was to follow the surveyors for two years from the start of the transition and investigate how perceived consequences of the transition job organizational factors wellbeing and effectiveness measures changed between 1998 and 2000 the teamwork profile and qps nordic questionnaire were used the 205 surveyors who participated in all three study phases constituted the study group the result showed that surveyors who perceived that they were working as generalists rated the improvements in job and organizational factors significantly higher than those who perceived that they were not yet generalists improvements were noted in 2000 in quality of service to clients time available to handle a case and effectiveness of teamwork in a

outline of perspective projections is considered metric perception of the inner structure of such projections was quite limited systematic distortions were found especially with more extreme slants and attributed to the joint effect of several factors anchors 3d information and slant underestimation contradictory flatness cues did not detract from performance while stereoptic information

market as total cost of ownership becomes increasingly important and as budgets are squeezed the most costeffective solutions are those that will survive this shakedown hmatrix approximation for the operator exponential with applications we previously developed a datasparse and accurate approximation to parabolic solution operators in the case of a rather general elliptic part given by a strongly ppositive operator  also a class of matrices hmatrices has been analysed which are datasparse and allow an approximate matrix arithmetic with almost linear complexity in particular the matrixvectormatrixmatrix product with such matrices as well as the computation of the inverse have linearlogarithmic cost in this paper we apply the hmatrix techniques to approximate the exponent of an elliptic operator starting with the dunfordcauchy representation for the operator exponent we then discretise the integral by the exponentially convergent quadrature rule involving a short sum of resolvents the latter are approximated by the hmatrices our algorithm inherits a twolevel parallelism with respect to both the computation of resolvents and the treatment of different time values in the case of smooth data coefficients boundaries we prove the linearlogarithmic complexity of the method convergence of a finite volume scheme for nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations one approximates the entropy weak solution u of a nonlinear parabolic degenerate equation usub tdivqfu delta phi u0 by a piecewise constant function usub d using a discretization d in space and time and a finite volume scheme the convergence of usub d to u is shown as the size of the space and time steps tend to zero in a first step estimates on usub d are used to prove the convergence up to a subsequence of usub d to a measure valued entropy solution called here an entropy process solution a result of uniqueness of the entropy process solution is proved yielding the strong convergence of usub d to u some numerical results on a model equation are shown the best circulant preconditioners for hermitian toeplitz systemsii the multiplezero case for pti see siam j numer anal vol 38 p 876896 circulanttype preconditioners have been proposed previously for illconditioned hermitian toeplitz systems that are generated by nonnegative continuous functions with a zero of even order the proposed circulant preconditioners can be constructed without requiring explicit knowledge of the generating functions it was shown that the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded except for a fixed number of outliers and that all eigenvalues are uniformly bounded away from zero therefore the conjugate gradient method converges linearly when applied to solving the circulant preconditioned systems previously it was claimed that this result can be extended to the case where the generating functions have multiple zeros the main aim of this paper is to give a complete convergence proof of the method for this class of generating functions numerical validation of solutions of complementarity problems the nonlinear case this paper proposes a validation method for solutions of nonlinear complementarity problems the validation procedure performs a computational test if the result of the test is positive then it is guaranteed that a given multidimensional interval either includes a solution or excludes all solutions of the nonlinear complementarity problem an empirical investigation of the influences of the degree of interactivity on useroutcomes in a multimedia environment the study reported here investigates the influence of interactivity on the learning outcomes of users in a multimedia systems environment drawing from past literature base and based on key tenets of three learning theories  behaviorist cognitivist and constructivist  the study first proposes a measurement scheme for interactivity and then hypothesizes that interactivity would influence the learning outcomes positively in terms of users learning achievement and attitude three prototypes of a multimedia instructionaltraining system to represent high low and noninteractive modes of use were developed and implemented and the hypothesized influences were investigated using a controlled laboratory research design multiple analysis of variance manova results indicate that while interactivity does not necessarily enable enhanced gain in user learning it positively influences participants attitude the study finds no support for hypothesized moderating effects of learning styles measured using kolbs learning style inventory scale on the relationship between interactivity and user outcomes the results of this study have important implications for both education and corporations training efforts and investments implications and future research directions are discussed impact of user satisfaction and trust on virtual team members pressured by the growing need for fast response times mass customization and globalization many organizations are turning to flexible organizational forms such as virtual teams virtual teams consist of cooperative relationships supported by information technology to overcome limitations of time andor location virtual teams require their members to rely heavily on the use of information technology and trust in coworkers this study investigates the impacts that the reliance on information technology operationalized in our study via the user satisfaction construct and trust have on the job satisfaction of virtual team members the study findings reveal that both user satisfaction and trust are positively related to job satisfaction in virtual teams while system use was not found to play a significant role these findings emphasize that organizations seeking the benefits of flexible itenabled virtual teams must consider both the level of trust among colleagues and the users satisfaction with the information technology on which virtual teams rely breaking the myths of rewards an exploratory study of attitudes about knowledge sharing many ceo and managers understand the importance of knowledge sharing among their employees and are eager to introduce the knowledge management paradigm in their organizations however little is known about the determinants of the individuals knowledge sharing behavior the purpose of this study is to develop an understanding of the factors affecting the individuals knowledge sharing behavior in the organizational context the research model includes various constructs based on social exchange theory selfefficacy and theory of reasoned action research results from the field survey of 467 employees of four large public organizations show that expected associations and contribution are the major determinants of the individuals attitude toward knowledge sharing expected rewards believed by many to be the most important motivating factor for knowledge sharing are not significantly related to the attitude toward knowledge sharing as expected positive attitude toward knowledge sharing is found to lead to positive intention to share knowledge and finally to actual knowledge sharing behaviors chaos theory as a framework for studying information systems this paper introduces chaos theory as a means of studying information systems it argues that chaos theory combined with new techniques for discovering patterns in complex quantitative and qualitative evidence offers a potentially more substantive approach to understand the nature of information systems in a variety of contexts the paper introduces chaos theory concepts by way of an illustrative research design mobile commerce transforming the vision into reality this editorial preface investigates current developments in mobile commerce mcommerce and proposes an integrated architecture that supports business and consumer needs in an optimal way to successfully implement mcommerce business processes the key line of thought is based on the heuristic observation that customers will not want to receive mcommerce offerings to their mobile telephones as a result a pull as opposed to a push approach becomes a necessary requirement to conduct mcommerce in addition mcommerce has to rely on local regional demographic and many other variables to be truly effective both observations necessitate an mcommerce architecture that allows the coherent integration of enterpriselevel systems as well as the aggregation of product and service offerings from many different and partially competing parties into a collaborative mcommerce platform the key software component within this integrated architecture is an event management engine to monitor detect store process and measure information about outside events that are relevant to all participants in mcommerce the semantic web differentiating between taxonomies and ontologies there is a new vision of the www  the semantic web  that will dramatically improve webbased services and products it creates a setting where software agents perform everyday jobs for endusers deploying hierarchies metadata and structured vocabularies the semantic web expands basic internet functions a regularized conjugate gradient method for symmetric positive definite system of linear equations a class of regularized conjugate gradient methods is presented for solving the large sparse system of linear equations of which the coefficient matrix is an illconditioned symmetric positive definite matrix the convergence properties of these methods are discussed in depth and the best possible choices of the parameters involved in the new methods are investigated in detail numerical computations show that the new methods are more efficient and robust than both classical relaxation methods and classical conjugate direction methods the road to perpetual progress retail inventory management with annual revenues increasing 170 to

traffic as well as the widespread adoption of operations research techniques in airline scheduling has given rise to tight flight schedules at major airports an undesirable consequence of this is that a minor incident such as a delay in the arrival of a small number of flights can result in a chain reaction of events involving several flights and airports causing disruption throughout the system this paper reviews recent literature in the area of recovery from schedule disruptions first we review how disturbances at a given airport could be handled including the effects of runways and fixes then we study the papers on recovery from airline schedule perturbations which involve adjustments in flight schedules aircraft and crew the mathematical programming techniques used in ground holding are covered in some detail we conclude the review with suggestions on how singular perturbation theory could play a role in analyzing disruptions to such highly sensitive schedules as those in the civil aviation industry airline base schedule optimisation by flight network annealing a system for rigorous airline base schedule optimisation is described the architecture of the system reflects the underlying problem structure the architecture is hierarchical consisting of a master problem for logical aircraft schedule optimisation and a subproblem for schedule evaluation the subproblem is made up of a number of component subproblems including connection generation passenger choice modelling passenger traffic allocation by simulation and revenue and cost determination schedule optimisation is carried out by means of simulated annealing of flight networks the operators for the simulated annealing process are feasibility preserving and form a complete set of operators combining constraint programming and linear programming on an example of bus driver scheduling provides details of a successful application where the column generation algorithm was used to combine constraint programming and linear programming in the past constraint programming and linear programming were considered to be two competing technologies that solved similar types of problems both these technologies had their strengths and weaknesses the paper shows that the two technologies can be combined together to extract the strengths of both these technologies details of a realworld application to optimize bus driver duties are given this system was developed by ilog for a major software house in japan using ilogsolver and ilogcplex constraint programming and linear programming cc libraries elastic constraint branching the wedelincarmen lagrangian heuristic and integer programming for personnel scheduling the wedelin algorithm is a lagrangian based heuristic that is being successfully used by carmen systems to solve large crew pairing problems within the airline industry we extend the wedelin approach by developing an implementation for personnel scheduling problems also termed staff rostering problems that exploits the special structure of these problems we also introduce elastic constraint branching with the twin aims of improving the performance of our new approach and making it more column generation friendly numerical results show that our approach can outperform the commercial solver cplex on difficult commercial rostering problems supply chain optimisation in the paper industry we describe the formulation and development of a supplychain optimisation model for fletcher challenge paper australasia fcpa this model known as the paper industry value optimisation tool pivot is a large mixed integer program that finds an optimal allocation of supplier to mill product to paper machine and paper machine to customer while at the same time modelling many of the supply chain details and nuances which are peculiar to fcpa pivot has assisted fcpa in solving a number of strategic and tactical decision problems and provided significant economic benefits for the company business school research bridging the gap between producers and consumers there has been a great deal of continuing discussion concerning the seemingly unbridgeable gap between so much of the research produced by business school professors and the needs of the business people who ideally would use it here we examine this gap and suggest a model for bridging it we sample four groups of people business school academics professors deans of business schools executive mba studentsrecent graduates and senior business executives each group rates 44 different potential properties of exemplary research we analyze withingroup differences and more meaningfully betweengroup differences we then offer commentary on the results and use the results to develop the aforementioned suggestions for bridging the gap we find an integrated optimization model for train crew management train crew management involves the development of a duty timetable for each of the drivers crew to cover a given train timetable in a rail transport organization this duty timetable is spread over a certain period known as the roster planning horizon train crew management may arise either from the planning stage when the total number of crew and crew distributions are to be determined or from the operating stage when the number of crew at each depot is known as input data in this paper we are interested in train crew management in the planning stage in the literature train crew management is decomposed into two stages crew scheduling and crew rostering which are solved sequentially we propose an integrated optimization model to solve both crew scheduling and crew rostering the model enables us to generate either cyclic rosters or noncyclic rosters numerical experiments are carried out over data sets arising from a practical application cane railway scheduling via constraint logic programming labelling order and constraints in a reallife application in australia cane transport is the largest unit cost in the manufacturing of raw sugar making up around 35 of the total manufacturing costs producing efficient schedules for the cane railways can result in significant cost savings the paper presents a study using constraint logic programming clp to solve the cane transport scheduling problem tailored heuristic labelling order and constraints strategies are proposed and encouraging results of application to several test problems and one reallife case are presented the preliminary results demonstrate that clp can be used as an effective tool for solving the cane transport scheduling problem with a potential decrease in development costs of the scheduling system it can also be used as an efficient tool for rescheduling tasks which the existing cane transport scheduling system cannot perform well two issues in setting call centre staffing levels motivated by a problem facing the police communication centre in auckland new zealand we consider the setting of staffing levels in a call centre with priority customers the choice of staffing level over any particular time period eg monday from 8 am9 am relies on accurate arrival rate information the usual method for identifying the arrival rate based on historical data can in some cases lead to considerable errors in performance estimates for a given staffing level we explain why identify three potential causes of the difficulty and describe a method for detecting and addressing such a problem mission planning for regional surveillance the regional surveillance problem discussed involves formulating a flight route for an aircraft to scan a given geographical region aerial surveillance is conducted using a synthetic aperture radar device mounted on the aircraft to compose a complete highresolution image of the region two models for determining an optimised flight route are described the first employing integer programming and the second genetic algorithms a comparison of the solution optimality in terms of the total distance travelled and model efficiency of the two techniques in terms of their required cpu times is made in order to identify the conditions under which it is appropriate to apply each model a column generation approach to delivery planning over time with inhomogeneous service providers and service interval constraints we consider a problem of delivery planning over multiple time periods deliveries must be made to customers having nominated demand in each time period demand must be met in each time period by use of some combination of inhomogeneous service providers each service provider has a different delivery capacity different cost of delivery to each customer a different utilisation requirement and different rules governing the spread of deliveries in time the problem is to plan deliveries so as to minimise overall costs subject to demand being met and service rules obeyed a natural integer programming model was found to be intractable except on problems with loose demand constraints with gaps between best lower bound and best feasible solution of up to 351 with an average of 154 over the test data set in all but the problem with loosest demand constraints cplex 65 applied to this formulation failed to find the optimal solution before running out of memory however a column generation approach improved the lower bound by between 06 and 219 with an average of 99 and in all cases found the optimal solution at the root node without requiring branching an operations research approach to the problem of the sugar cane selection selection for superior clones is the most important aspect of sugar cane improvement programs and is a long and expensive process while studies have investigated different components of selection independently there has not been a whole system approach to improve the process this study observes the problem as an integrated system where if one parameter changes the state of the whole system changes a computer based stochastic simulation model that accurately represents the selection was developed the paper describes the simulation model showing its accuracy as well as how a combination of dynamic programming and branch and bound can be applied to the model to optimise the selection system giving a new application of these techniques the model can be directly applied to any region targeted by sugar cane breeding programs or to other clonally propagated crops an optimization based approach to the train operator scheduling problem at singapore mrt singapore mass rapid transit smrt operates two train lines with 83 kilometers of track and 48 stations a total of 77 trains are in operation during peak hours and 41 during offpeak hours we report on an optimization based approach to develop a computerized trainoperator scheduling system that has been implemented at smrt the approach involves a bipartite matching algorithm for the generation of night duties and a tabu search algorithm for the generation of day duties the system automates the trainoperator scheduling process at smrt and produces favorable schedules in comparison with the manual process it is also able to handle the multiple objectives inherent in the crew scheduling system while trying to minimize the system wide crewrelated costs the system is also able to address concern with respect to the number of split duties minimised geometric buchberger algorithm for integer programming recently various algebraic integer programming ip solvers have been proposed based on the theory of grobner bases the main difficulty of these solvers is the size of the grobner bases generated in algorithms proposed so far large grobner bases are generated by either introducing additional variables or by considering the generic ip problem ipsub ac some improvements have been proposed such as hosten and sturmfels method grin designed to avoid additional variables and thomas truncated grobner basis method which computes the reduced grobner basis for a specific ip problem ipsub acb rather than its generalisation ipac in this paper we propose a new algebraic algorithm for solving ip problems the new algorithm called minimised geometric buchberger algorithm combines hosten and sturmfels grin and thomas truncated grobner basis method to compute the fundamental segments of an ip problem ipsub ac directly in its original space and also the truncated grobner basis for a specific ip problem ipsub ac b we have carried out experiments to compare this algorithm with others such as the geometric buchberger algorithm the truncated geometric buchberger algorithm and the algorithm in grin these experiments show that the new algorithm offers significant performance improvement parallel interior point schemes for solving multistage convex programming the predictorcorrector interiorpoint pathfollowing algorithm is promising in solving multistage convex programming problems among many other general good features of this algorithm especially attractive is that the algorithm allows the possibility to parallelise the major computations the dynamic structure of the multistage problems specifies a blocktridiagonal system at each newton step of the algorithm a wraparound permutation is then used to implement the parallel computation for this step project scheduling under time dependent costsa branch and bound algorithm in a given project network execution of each activity in normal duration requires utilization of certain resources if faster execution of an activity is desired then additional resources at extra cost would be required given a project network the cost structure for each activity and a planning horizon the project compression problem is concerned with the determination of optimal schedule of performing each activity while satisfying given restrictions and minimizing the total cost of project execution the paper considers the project compression problem with time dependent cost structure for each activity the planning horizon is divided into several regular time intervals over which the cost structure of an activity may vary but the cost structure of the activities remains the same within a time interval the objective is to find an optimal project schedule minimizing the total project cost we present a mathematical model for this problem develop some heuristics and an exact branch and bound algorithm using simulated problems we provide an insight into the computational performances of heuristics and the branch and bound algorithm nurturing clients trust to encourage engagement success during the customization of erp systems customization is a crucial lengthy and costly aspect in the successful implementation of erp systems and has accordingly become a major specialty of many vendors and consulting companies the study examines how such companies can increase their clients perception of engagement success through increased client trust that is brought about through responsive and dependable customization survey data from erp customization clients show that as hypothesized clients trust influenced their perception of engagement success with the company the data also show that clients trust in the customization company was increased when the company behaved in accordance with client expectations by being responsive and decreased when the company behaved in a manner that contradicted these expectations by not being dependable responses to an openended question addendum attached to the survey corroborated the importance of responsiveness and dependability implications for customization companies and research on trust are discussed minimizing weighted number of early and tardy jobs with a common due window involving location penalty studies a single machine scheduling problem to minimize the weighted number of early and tardy jobs with a common due window there are n nonpreemptive and simultaneously available jobs each job will incur an early tardy penalty if it is early tardy with respect to the common due window under a given schedule the window size is a given parameter but the window location is a decision variable the objective of the problem is to find a schedule that minimizes the weighted number of early and tardy jobs and the location penalty we show that the problem is npcomplete in the ordinary sense and develop a dynamic programming based pseudopolynomial algorithm we conduct computational experiments the results of which show that the performance of the dynamic algorithm is very good in terms of memory requirement and cpu time we also provide polynomial time algorithms for two special cases one and two facility network design revisited the one facility one commodity network design problem ofoc with nonnegative flow costs considers the problem of sending d units of flow from a source to a destination where arc capacity is purchased in batches of c units the two facility problem tfoc is similar but capacity can be purchased either in batches of c units or one unit flow costs are zero these problems are known to be nphard we describe an exact onsup 33sup n algorithm for these problems based on the repeated use of a bipartite matching algorithm we also present a better lower bound of omega nsup 2k for an earlier omega nsup 2k algorithm described in the literature where k  dc and k  mink n 22 the matching algorithm is faster than this one for k or n  22 finally we provide another reformulation of the problem that is quasi integral this property could be useful in designing a modified version of the simplex method to solve the problem using a sequence of pivots with integer extreme solutions referred to as the integral simplex method in the

argues darren atkinson cto formscape mrp in a job shop environment using a resource constrained project scheduling model one of the most difficult tasks in a job shop manufacturing environment is to balance schedule and capacity in an ongoing basis mrp systems are commonly used for scheduling although their inability to deal with capacity constraints adequately is a severe drawback in this study we show that material requirements planning can be done more effectively in a job shop environment using a resource constrained project scheduling model the proposed model augments mrp models by incorporating capacity constraints and using variable lead time lengths the efficacy of this approach is tested on mrp systems by comparing the inventory carrying costs and resource allocation of the solutions obtained by the proposed model to those obtained by using a traditional mrp model in general it is concluded that the proposed model provides improved schedules with considerable reductions

and cut costs product development using a 3d computer model to optimize the stability of the rocket tm powered wheelchair a threedimensional 3d lumpedparameter model of a powered wheelchair was created to aid the development of the rocket prototype wheelchair and to help explore the effect of innovative design features on its stability the model was developed using simulation software specifically working model 3d the accuracy of the model was determined by comparing both its static stability angles and dynamic behavior as it passed down a 48cm 19 road curb at a heading of 45 degrees with the performance of the actual wheelchair the models predictions of the static stability angles in the forward rearward and lateral directions were within 93 71 and 38 of the measured values respectively the average absolute error in the predicted position of the wheelchair as it moved down the curb was 22 cmm 09 per 33 traveled the accuracy was limited by the inability to model soft bodies the inherent difficulties in modeling a statically indeterminate system and the computing time nevertheless it was found to be useful in investigating the effect of eight design alterations on the lateral stability of the wheelchair stability was quantified by determining the static lateral stability angles and the maximum height of a road curb over which the wheelchair could successfully drive on a diagonal heading the model predicted that the stability was more dependent on the configuration of the suspension system than on the dimensions and weight distribution of the wheelchair furthermore for the situations and design alterations studied predicted improvements in static stability were not correlated with improvements in dynamic stability medical image computing

included exact frequencydomain reconstruction for thermoacoustic tomography i planar geometry we report an exact and fast fourierdomain reconstruction algorithm for thermoacoustic tomography in a planar configuration assuming thermal confinement and constant acoustic speed the effects of the finite size of the detector and the finite length of the excitation pulse are explicitly included in the reconstruction algorithm the algorithm is numerically and experimentally verified we also demonstrate that the blurring caused by the finite size of the detector surface is the primary limiting factor on the resolution and that it can be compensated for by deconvolution timedomain reconstruction for thermoacoustic tomography in a spherical geometry reconstructionbased microwaveinduced thermoacoustic tomography in a spherical configuration is presented thermoacoustic waves from biological tissue samples excited by microwave pulses are measured by a wideband unfocused ultrasonic transducer which is set on a spherical surface enclosing the sample sufficient data are acquired from different directions to reconstruct the microwave absorption distribution an exact reconstruction solution is derived and approximated to a modified backprojection algorithm experiments demonstrate that the reconstructed images agree well with the original samples the spatial resolution of the system reaches 05 mm fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control of linear stochastic systems with unknown inputs this paper presents an integrated robust fault detection and isolation fdi and fault tolerant control ftc scheme for a fault in actuators or sensors of linear stochastic systems subjected to unknown inputs disturbances as usual in this kind of works it is assumed that single fault occurs at a time and the fault treated is of random bias type the fdi module is constructed using banks of robust twostage kalman filters which simultaneously estimate the state and the fault bias and generate residual sets decoupled from unknown disturbances all elements of residual sets are evaluated by using a hypothesis statistical test and the fault is declared according to the prepared decision logic the ftc module is activated based on the fault indicator and additive compensation signal is computed using the fault bias estimate and combined to the nominal control law for compensating the faults effect on the system simulation results for the simplified longitudinal flight control system with parameter variations process and measurement noises demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed the impact of the product mix on the value of flexibility productmix flexibility is one of the major types of manufacturing flexibility referring to the ability to produce a broad range of products or variants with presumed low changeover costs the value of such a capability is important to establish for an industrial firm in order to ensure that the flexibility provided will be at the right level and used profitably rather than in excess of market requirements and consequently costly we use optionpricing theory to analyse the impact of various productmix issues on the value of flexibility the real options model we use incorporates multiple products capacity constraints as well as setup costs the issues treated here include the number of products demand variability correlation between products and the relative demand distribution within the product mix thus we are interested in the nature of the input data to analyse its effect on the value of flexibility we also check the impact at different capacity levels the results suggest that the value of flexibility i increases with an increasing number of products ii decreases with increasing volatility of product demand iii decreases the more positively correlated the demand is and iv reduces for marginal capacity with increasing levels of capacity of these the impact of positively correlated demand seems to be a major issue however the joint impact of the number of products and demand correlation showed some nonintuitive results computation of unmeasured

equations a simple firstorder integration is used to solve the odes estimation of 3d left ventricular deformation from medical images using biomechanical models the quantitative estimation of regional cardiac deformation from threedimensional 3d image sequences has important clinical implications for the assessment of viability in the heart wall we present here a generic methodology for estimating soft tissue deformation which integrates imagederived information with biomechanical models and apply it to the problem of cardiac deformation estimation the method is image modality independent the images are segmented interactively and then initial correspondence is established using a shapetracking approach a dense motion field is then estimated using a transversely isotropic linearelastic model which accounts for the muscle fiber directions in the left ventricle the dense motion field is in turn used to calculate the deformation of the heart wall in terms of strain in cardiac specific directions the strains obtained using this approach in openchest dogs before and after coronary occlusion exhibit a high correlation with strains produced in the same animals using implanted markers further they show good agreement with previously published results in the literature this proposed method provides quantitative regional 3d estimates of heart deformation reconstruction of timevarying 3d leftventricular shape from multiview xray cineangiocardiograms this paper reports on the clinical application of a system for recovering the timevarying threedimensional 3d leftventricular lv shape from multiview xray cineangiocardiograms considering that xray cineangiocardiography is still commonly employed in clinical cardiology and computational costs for 3d recovery and visualization are rapidly decreasing it is meaningful to develop a clinically applicable system for 3d lv shape recovery from xray cineangiocardiograms the system is based on a previously reported closedsurface method of shape recovery from twodimensional occluding contours with multiple views to apply the method to real lv cineangiocardiograms userinteractive systems were implemented for preprocessing including detection of lv contours calibration of the imaging geometry and setting of the lv model coordinate system the results for three real lv angiographic image sequences are presented two with fixed multiple views using supplementary angiography and one with rotating views 3d reconstructions utilizing different numbers of views were compared and evaluated in terms of contours manually traced by an experienced radiologist the performance of the preprocesses was also evaluated and the effects of variations in userspecified parameters on the final 3d reconstruction results were shown to be sufficiently small these experimental results demonstrate the potential usefulness of combining multiple views for 3d recovery from real lv cineangiocardiograms statistical analysis of nonlinearly reconstructed nearinfrared tomographic images ii experimental interpretation for pt i see ibid vol 21 no 7 p 75563 2002 image error analysis of a diffuse nearinfrared tomography nir system has been carried out on simulated data using a statistical approach described in pt i of this paper pogue et al 2002 the methodology is used here with experimental data acquired on phantoms with a prototype imaging system intended for characterizing breast tissue results show that imaging performance is not limited by random measurement error but rather by calibration issues the image error over the entire field of view is generally not minimized when an accurate homogeneous estimate of the phantom properties is available however local image error over a target region of interest roi is reduced the image reconstruction process which includes a levenbergmarquardt style regularization provides good minimization of the objective function yet its reduction is not always correlated with an overall image error decrease minimization of the bias in an roi which contains localized changes in the optical properties can be achieved through five to nine iterations of the algorithm precalibration of the algorithm through statistical evaluation of phantom studies may provide a better measure of the image accuracy than that implied by minimization of the standard objective

spatial property values from measurements of the light flux at the surface of the tissue in this study meansquared error mse over the image is used to evaluate methods for regularizing the illposed inverse image reconstruction problem in nir tomography estimates of image bias and image standard deviation were calculated based upon 100 repeated reconstructions of a test image with randomly distributed noise added to the light flux measurements it was observed that the bias error dominates at high regularization parameter values while variance dominates as the algorithm is allowed to approach the optimal solution this optimum does not necessarily correspond to the minimum projection error solution but typically requires further iteration with a decreasing regularization parameter to reach the lowest image error increasing measurement noise causes a need to constrain the minimum regularization parameter to higher values in order to achieve a minimum in the overall image mse the use of visual search for knowledge gathering in image decision support this paper presents a new method of knowledge gathering for decision support in image understanding based on information extracted from the dynamics of saccadic eye movements the framework involves the construction of a generic image feature extraction library from which the feature extractors that are most relevant to the visual assessment by domain experts are determined automatically through factor analysis the dynamics of the visual search are analyzed by using the markov model for providing training information to novices on how and where to look for image features the validity of the framework has been evaluated in a clinical scenario whereby the pulmonary vascular distribution on computed tomography images was assessed by experienced radiologists as a potential indicator of heart failure the performance of the system has been demonstrated by training four novices to follow the visual assessment behavior of two experienced observers in all cases the accuracy of the students improved from near random decision making 33 to accuracies ranging from 50 to 68 quantitative analysis of reconstructed 3d coronary arterial tree and intracoronary devices traditional quantitative coronary angiography is performed on twodimensional 2d projection views these views are chosen by the angiographer to minimize vessel overlap and foreshortening with 2d projection views that are acquired in this nonstandardized fashion however there is no way to know or estimate how much error occurs in the qca process furthermore coronary arteries possess a curvilinear shape and undergo a cyclical deformation due to their attachment to the myocardium therefore it is necessary to obtain threedimensional 3d information to best describe and quantify the dynamic curvilinear nature of the human coronary artery using a patientspecific 3d coronary reconstruction algorithm and routine angiographic images a new technique is proposed to describe 1 the curvilinear nature of 3d coronary arteries and intracoronary devices 2 the magnitude of the arterial deformation caused by intracoronary devices and due to heart motion and 3 optimal views with respect to the desired pathway for delivering intracoronary devices tactical airborne reconnaissance goes dualband and beyond multispectral imaging technologies are satisfying the need for a persistent look at the battlefield we highlight the need to persistently monitor a battlefield to determine exactly who and what is there for example infrared imaging can be used to expose the fuel status of an aircraft on the runway a daytime visiblespectrum image of the same aircraft would offer information about external details such as the planes markings and paint scheme a dualband camera enables precision image registration by fusion and frequently yields more information than is possible by evaluating the images separately a study of hospitality and tourism information technology education and industrial applications the purpose of this study was to examine the subject relevance of information technology it in hospitality and tourism management programs with skills deployed in the workplace this study aimed at investigating graduates transition from education to employment and to determine how well they appear to be equipped to meet the needs of the hospitality and tourism industry one hundred and seventeen graduates responded to a mail survey these graduates rated the importance of it skills in the workplace the level of it teaching in hotel and tourism management programs and the selfcompetence level in it this study concluded that a gap exists between the it skills required at work and those acquired at university development of computermediated teaching resources for tourism distance education the university of otago model this article presents a qualitative account of the development of computermediated tourism distance learning resources a distance learning model was developed at the centre for tourism university of otago new zealand in 19981999 the article reviews the development of this internetbased learning resource explaining the design and development of programme links providing study information for students and paper links course material and learning features the design of course material is reviewed with emphasis given to consistency of presentation between papers the template for course material is described and illustrated and the article concludes with an overview of important design considerations education training and development policies and practices in mediumsized companies in the uk do they really influence firm performance this paper sets out to examine the relationship between training and firm performance in middlesized uk companies it recognises that there is evidence that high performance work practices appear to be associated with better performance in large us companies but argues that this relationship is less likely to be present in middlesized companies the papers key contribution is to justify the wider concept of education training and development etd as applicable to such companies it then finds that clusters of some etd variables do appear to be associated with better middlesized company performance vonnahbp a multimedia learning package on hotel budget planning in this paper a new learning package vonnahbp which provides an interactive and online environment for novices to study and practice hotel budget planning is introduced its design philosophy will be discussed thoughtfully with special focus on how to make use of the multimedia and internet according to literatures learning packages are faced to be more effective in delivering teaching material researchers indicate that students using a selfpaced learning package score higher than in a traditional classroom setting moreover the learning package provides different scenarios for students to explore themselves in a practical environment and is more cost effective and systematic than lectures currently most learning packages in hotel education are not implemented using multimedia with internet access our paper describes a new learning package that fills the gaps vonnahbp requires participants to investigate operational budgets on various areas such as sales levels payroll inventory level promotion strategies and facilities planning etc eventually the studentsnovices are required to practice their skills in a comprehensive case about a hypothetical hotel they need to solve managerial problems by a combination of budgetary planning on human resources staff training programmes facilities maintenance and replacement or promotion schemes analytical tools are available for studentsnovices to judge an appropriate decision in handling constrained resources developing a cdrom as a teaching and learning tool in food and beverage management a case study in hospitality education food and beverage management is the traditional core of hospitality education but in its laboratory manifestation has come under increasing pressure in recent years it is an area that arguably presents the greatest challenges in adaptation to contemporary learning technologies but at the same time stands to benefit most from the potential of the web this paper addresses the design and development of a cdrom learning resource for food and beverage it is a learning resource which is designed to integrate with rather than to replace existing conventional classroom and laboratory learning methods and thus compensate for the decline in the resource base faced in food and beverage education in recent years the paper includes illustrative material drawn from the cdrom which demonstrates its use in teaching and learning eliminating counterevidence with applications to accountable certificate management this paper presents a method to increase the accountability of certificate management by making it intractable for the certification authority ca to create contradictory statements about the validity of a certificate the core of the method is a new primitive undeniable attester that allows someone to commit to some set s of bitstrings by publishing a short digest of s and to give attestations for any x that it is or is not a member of s such an attestation can be verified by obtaining in an authenticated way the published digest and applying a verification algorithm to the triple of the bitstring the attestation and the digest the most important feature of this primitive is the intractability of creating two contradictory proofs for the same candidate element x and digest we give an efficient construction for undeniable attesters based on authenticated search trees we show that the construction also applies to sets of more structured elements we also show that undeniable attesters exist iff collisionresistant hash functions exist a uniform framework for regulating service access and information release on the web the widespread use of internetbased services is increasing the amount of information such as user profiles that clients are required to disclose this information demand is necessary for regulating access to services and functionally convenient eg to support service customization but it has raised privacyrelated concerns which if not addressed may affect the users disposition to use network services at the same time servers need to regulate service access without disclosing entirely the details of their access control policy there is therefore a pressing need for privacyaware techniques to regulate access to services open to the network we propose an approach for regulating service access and information disclosure on the web the approach consists of a uniform formal framework to formulate  and reason about  both service access and information disclosure constraints it also provides a means for parties to communicate their requirements while ensuring that no private information be disclosed and that the communicated requirements are correct with respect to the constraints hordes a multicast based protocol for anonymity with widespread acceptance of the internet as a public medium for communication and information retrieval there has been rising concern that the personal privacy of users can be eroded by cooperating network entities a technical solution to maintaining privacy is to provide anonymity we present a protocol for initiator anonymity called hordes which uses forwarding mechanisms similar to those used in previous protocols for sending data but is the first protocol to make use of multicast routing to anonymously receive data we show this results in shorter transmission latencies and requires less work of the protocol participants in terms of the messages processed we also present a comparison of the security and anonymity of hordes with previous protocols using the first quantitative definition of anonymity and unlinkability our analysis shows that hordes provides anonymity in a degree similar to that of crowds and onion routing but also that hordes has numerous performance advantages informationprocessing and computing systems at thermal power stations in china the development and commissioning of informationprocessing and computing

with predictive segmentation health care technology and technological advances have always been a part of healthcare but often its advances in treatment machinery and materials that get the attention however technology gains also occur behind the scenes in operations one of the less glamorous but powerful technological advances available today is predictive segmentation a phrase that means a new way to assess and view individuals in the market based on their health status and health needs sophisticated databases data mining neural networks and statistical capabilities have enabled the development of predictive segmentation techniques these predictive models for healthcare can identify who is likely to need certain services and who is likely to become ill they are a significant

three year escience research and development programme the programme has a bold vision to change the dynamic of the way science is undertaken the term escience was introduced by john taylor director general of research councils in the office of science and technology he saw many areas of science becoming increasingly reliant on new ways of collaborative multidisciplinary interorganisation working escience is intended to capture these new modes of working there are two major components to the programme the science and the infrastructure to support that science the infrastructure is generally referred to as the grid the choice of name resonates with the idea of a future in which computing resources and storage as well as expensive scientific facilities and software can be accessed on

knowledgebased control systems in the area of biotechnological processes has become increasingly popular over the past decade this paper outlines the structure of the advanced knowledgebased part of the biogenes copyright control system for the control of bioprocesses such as the fedbatch saccharomyces cerevisiae cultivation first a brief overview of all the tasks implemented in the knowledgebased level including process data classification qualitative process state identification and supervisory process control is given the procedures performing the online identification of metabolic states and supervisory process control setpoint calculation and control strategy selection are described in more detail finally the performance of the system is discussed using results obtained from a number of experimental cultivation runs in a laboratory unit verification of ideological classificationsa statistical approach the paper presents a statistical method of verifying ideological classifications of votes parliamentary votes preclassified by an expert on a chosen subset are verified at an assumed significance level by seeking the most likely match with the actual vote results classifications that do not meet the requirements defined are rejected the results obtained can be applied in the ideological dimensioning algorithms enabling ideological identification of dimensions obtained the top cycle and uncovered solutions for weak tournaments we study axiomatic properties of the top cycle and uncovered solutions for weak tournaments subsequently we establish its connection with the rational choice theory a sufficient condition for optimality in nondifferentiable invex programming a sufficient optimality condition is established for a nonlinear programming problem without differentiability assumption on the data wherein clarkes 1975 generalized gradient is used to define invexity adaptive stabilization of undamped flexible structures in the paper nonidentifierbased adaptive stabilization of undamped flexible structures is considered in the case of collocated input and output operators the systems have poles and zeros on the imaginary axis in the case where velocity feedback is available the adaptive stabilizer is constructed by an adaptive pdcontroller proportional plus derivative controller in the case where only position feedback is available the adaptive stabilizer is constructed by an adaptive pcontroller for the augmented system which consists of the controlled system and a parallel compensator numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers convergence of tolands critical points for sequences of dc functions and application to the resolution of semilinear elliptic problems we prove that if a sequence fsub nsub n of dc functions difference of two convex functions converges to a dc function f in some appropriate way and if usub n is a critical point of fsub n in the sense described by toland 1978 1979 and is such that usub nsub n converges to u then u is a critical point of f still in tolands sense we also build a new algorithm which searches for this critical point u and then apply it in order to compute the solution of a semilinear elliptic equation approximate relaxed descent method for optimal control problems we consider an optimal control problem for systems governed by ordinary differential equations with control constraints since no convexity assumptions are made on the data the problem is reformulated in relaxed form the relaxed state equation is discretized by the implicit trapezoidal scheme and the relaxed controls are approximated by piecewise constant relaxed controls we then propose a combined descent and discretization method that generates sequences of discrete relaxed controls and progressively refines the discretization since here the adjoint of the discrete state equation is not defined we use at each iteration an approximate derivative of the cost functional defined by discretizing the continuous adjoint equation and the integral involved by appropriate trapezoidal schemes it is proved that accumulation points of sequences constructed by this method satisfy the strong relaxed necessary conditions for optimality for the continuous problem finally the computed relaxed controls can be easily approximated by piecewise constant classical controls the exact solution of coupled thermoelectroelastic behavior of piezoelectric laminates exact solutions for static analysis of thermoelectroelastic laminated plates are presented in this analysis a new concise procedure for the analytical solution of composite laminated plates with piezoelectric layers is developed a simple eigenvalue formula in real number form is directly developed from the basic coupled piezoelectric differential equations and the difficulty of treating imaginary eigenvalues is avoided the solution is defined in the trigonometric series and can be applied to thin and thick plates numerical studies are conducted on a fivelayer piezoelectric plate and the complexity of stresses and deformations under combined loading is illustrated the results could be used as a benchmark for assessing any numerical solution by approximate approaches such as the finite element method while also providing useful physical insight into the behavior of piezoelectric plates in a thermal environment on a general constitutive description for the inelastic and failure behavior of fibrous laminates ii laminate theory and applications for pt i see ibid pp 115976 the two papers report systematically a constitutive description for the inelastic and strength behavior of laminated composites reinforced with various fiber preforms the constitutive relationship is established micromechanically through layerbylayer analysis namely only the properties of the constituent fiber and matrix materials of the composites are required as input data in the previous part lamina theory was presented three fundamental quantities of the laminae ie the internal stresses generated in the constituent fiber and matrix materials and the instantaneous compliance matrix with different fiber preform including woven braided and knitted fabric reinforcements were explicitly obtained by virtue of the bridging micromechanics model in this paper the laminate stress analysis is shown the purpose of this analysis is to determine the load shared by each lamina in the laminate so that the lamina theory can be applied incorporation of the constitutive equations into an fem software package is illustrated a number of application examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the constitutive theory the predictions made include failure envelopes of multidirectional laminates subjected to biaxial inplane loads thermomechanical cycling stressstrain curves of a titanium metal matrix composite laminate sn curves of multilayer knitted fabric reinforced laminates under tensile fatigue and bending loaddeflection plots and ultimate bending strengths of laminated braided fabric reinforced beams subjected to lateral loads on a general constitutive description for the inelastic and failure behavior of fibrous laminates i lamina theory it is well known that a structural design with isotropic materials can only be accomplished based on a stress failure criterion this is however generally not true with laminated composites only when the laminate is subjected to an inplane load can the ultimate failure of the laminate correspond to its lastply failure and hence a stress failure criterion may be sufficient to detect the maximum load that can be sustained by the laminate even in such a case the load shared by each lamina in the laminate cannot be correctly determined if the lamina instantaneous stiffness matrix is inaccurately provided since the lamina is always statically indeterminate in the laminate if however the laminate is subjected to a lateral load its ultimate failure occurs before lastply failure and use of the stress failure criterion is no longer sufficient an additional critical deflection or curvature condition must also be employed this necessitates development of an efficient constitutive relationship for laminated composites in order that the laminate strainsdeflections up to ultimate failure can be accurately calculated a general constitutive description for the thermomechanical response of a fibrous laminate up to ultimate failure with applications to various fibrous laminates is presented in the two papers the constitutive relationship is obtained by combining classical lamination theory with a recently developed bridging micromechanics model through a layerbylayer analysis this paper focuses on lamina analysis advanced aerostatic stability analysis of cablestayed bridges using finiteelement method based on the concept of limit point instability an advanced nonlinear finiteelement method that can be used to analyze the aerostatic stability of cablestayed bridges is proposed both geometric nonlinearity and three components of wind loads are considered in this method the example bridge is the second santou bay cablestayed bridge with a main span length of 518 m built in china aerostatic stability of the example bridge is investigated using linear and proposed methods the effect of pitch moment coefficient on the aerostatic stability of the bridge has been studied the results show that the aerostatic instability analyses of cablestayed bridges based on the linear method considerably overestimate the windresisting capacity of cablestayed bridges the proposed method is highly accurate and efficient pitch moment coefficient has a major effect on the aerostatic stability of cablestayed bridges finally the aerostatic failure mechanism of cablestayed bridges is explained by tracing the aerostatic instability path diagnostic expert system using nonmonotonic reasoning the objective of this work is to develop an expert system for cucumber disorder diagnosis using nonmonotonic reasoning to handle the situation when the system cannot reach a conclusion one reason for this situation is when the information is incomplete another reason is when the domain knowledge itself is incomplete another reason is when the information is inconsistent this method maintains the truth of the system in case of changing a piece of information the proposed method uses two types of nonmonotonic reasoning namely default reasoning and reasoning in the presence of inconsistent information to achieve its goal a dynamic method for weighted linear least squares problems a new method for solving the weighted linear least squares problems with full rank is proposed based on the theory of liapunovs stability the method associates a dynamic system with a weighted linear least squares problem whose solution we are interested in and integrates the former numerically by an astable numerical method the numerical tests suggest that the new method is more than comparative with current conventional techniques based on the normal equations an adaptive time step procedure for a parabolic problem with blowup in this paper we introduce and analyze a fully discrete approximation for a parabolic problem with a nonlinear boundary condition which implies that the solutions blow up in finite time we use standard linear elements with mass lumping for the space variable for the time discretization we write the problem in an equivalent form which is obtained by introducing an appropriate time rescaling and then we use explicit rungekutta methods for this equivalent problem in order to motivate our procedure we present it first in the case of a simple ordinary differential equation and show how the blow up time is approximated in this case we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the blowup of the numerical solution and prove that the numerical blowup time converges to the continuous one we also study for the explicit euler approximation the localization of blowup points for the numerical scheme nonnested multilevel solvers for finite element discretisations of mixed problems we consider a general framework for analysing the convergence of multigrid solvers applied to finite element discretisations of mixed problems both of conforming and nonconforming type as a basic new feature our approach allows to use different finite element discretisations on each level of the multigrid hierarchy thus in our multilevel approach accurate higher order finite element discretisations can be combined with fast multilevel solvers based on lower order nonconforming finite element discretisations this leads to the design of efficient multilevel solvers for higher order finite element discretisations risk theory with a nonlinear dividend barrier in the framework of classical risk theory we investigate a surplus process in the presence of a nonlinear dividend barrier and derive equations for two characteristics of such a process the probability of survival and the expected sum of discounted dividend payments numbertheoretic solution techniques are developed for approximating these quantities and numerical illustrations are given for exponential claim sizes and a parabolic dividend barrier coordination crisis management communications during a crisis both internal and external set the tone during response and carry a message through recovery the authors describe how to set up a system for information coordination to make sure the right people get the right message and the organization stays in control theta functions with harmonic coefficients over number fields we investigate theta functions attached to quadratic forms over a number field k we establish a functional equation by regarding the theta functions as specializations of symplectic theta functions by applying a differential operator to the functional equation we show how theta functions with harmonic coefficients over k behave under modular transformations on the diophantine equation xsup 2qsup 2k1ysup n in this paper it has been proved that if q is an odd prime q not7 mod 8 n is an odd integer or5 n is not a multiple of 3 and h n1 where h is the class number of the filed q square root q then the diophantine equation xsup 2qsup 2k1ysup n has exactly two families of solutions q n k x y even unimodular gaussian lattices of rank 12 we classify even unimodular gaussian lattices of rank 12 that is even unimodular integral lattices of rank 12 over the ring of gaussian integers this is equivalent to the classification of the automorphisms tau with tau sup 21 in the automorphism groups of all the niemeier lattices which are even unimodular real integral lattices of rank 24 there are 28 even unimodular gaussian lattices of rank 12 up to equivalence hilbert modular threefolds of arithmetic genus one d weisser 1981 proved that there are exactly four galois cubic number fields with hilbert modular threefolds of arithmetic genus one in this paper we extend weissers work to cover all cubic number fields our main result is that there are exactly 33 fields with hilbert modular threefolds of arithmetic genus one these fields are enumerated explicitly on the padic birch swinnertondyer conjecture for nonsemistable reduction in this paper we examine the iwasawa theory of elliptic curves e with additive reduction at an odd prime p by extending perrinrious theory to certain nonsemistable representations we are able to convert katos zetaelements into padic lfunctions this allows us to deduce the cotorsion of the selmer group over the cyclotomic zsub pextension of q and thus prove an inequality in the padic birch and swinnertondyer conjecture at primes p whose square divides the conductor of e knowledge model reuse therapy decision through specialisation of a generic decision model we present the definition of the therapy decision task and its associated heuristic multiattribute hm solving method in the form of a kadsstyle specification the goal of the therapy decision task is to identify the ideal therapy for a given patient in accordance with a set of objectives of a diverse nature constituting a global therapyevaluation framework in which considerations such as patient preferences and qualityoflife results are integrated we give a highlevel overview of this task as a specialisation of the generic decision task and additional decomposition methods for the subtasks involved these subtasks possess some reflective capabilities for reasoning about selfmodels particularly the learning subtask which incrementally corrects and refines the model used to assess the effects of the therapies this work illustrates the process of reuse in the framework of ai software development methodologies such as kadscommonkads in order to obtain new more specialised but still generic components for the analysis libraries developed in this context in order to maximise reuse benefits where possible the therapy decision task and hm method have been defined in terms of regular components from the earliermentioned libraries to emphasise the importance of using a rigorous approach to the modelling of domain and method ontologies we make extensive use of the semiformal objectoriented analysis notation uml together with its associated constraint language ocl to illustrate the ontology of the decision method and the corresponding specific one of the therapy decision domain the latter being a refinement via inheritance of the former dihedral congruence primes and class fields of real quadratic fields we show that for a real quadratic field f the dihedral congruence primes with respect to f for cusp forms of weight k and quadratic nebentypus are essentially the primes dividing expressions of the form epsilon sub sup k1or1 where epsilon sub  is a totally positive fundamental unit of f this extends work of hida our results allow us to identify a family of ray class fields of f which are generated by torsion points on modular abelian varieties superconvergence of discontinuous galerkin method for nonstationary hyperbolic equation for the first order nonstationary hyperbolic equation taking the piecewise linear discontinuous galerkin solver we prove that under the uniform rectangular partition such a discontinuous solver after postprocessing can have two and half approximative order which is half order higher than the optimal estimate by p lesaint and p raviart 1974 under the rectangular partition laguerre pseudospectral method for nonlinear partial differential equations the laguerre gaussradau interpolation is investigated some approximation results are obtained as an example the laguerre pseudospectral scheme is constructed for the bbm equation the stability and the convergence of proposed scheme are proved the numerical results show the high accuracy of this approach numerical studies of 2d free surface waves with fixed bottom the motion of surface waves under the effect of bottom is a very interesting and challenging phenomenon in the nature we use boundary integral method to compute and analyze this problem in the linear analysis the linearized equations have bounded error increase under some compatible conditions this contributes to the cancellation of instable kelvinhelmholtz terms under the effect of bottom the existence of equations is hard to determine but given some limitations it proves true these limitations are that the swing of interfaces should be small enough and the distance between surface and bottom should be large enough in order to maintain the stability of computation some compatible relationship must be satisfied in the numerical examples the simulation of standing waves and breaking waves are calculated and in the case of shallow bottom we found that the behavior of waves are rather singular twoscale curved element method for elliptic problems with small periodic coefficients this paper is concerned with the second order elliptic problems with small periodic coefficients on a bounded domain with a curved boundary a twoscale curved element method which couples linear elements and isoparametric elements is proposed the error estimate is obtained over the given smooth domain furthermore an additive schwarz method is provided for the isoparametric element method on bandlimited scaling function this paper discusses bandlimited scaling function especially the single interval band case and three interval band cases their relationship to oversampling property and weakly translation invariance are also studied at the end we propose an open problem a note on vector cascade algorithm the focus of this paper is on the relationship between accuracy of multivariate refinable vector and vector cascade algorithm we show that if the vector cascade algorithm 15 with isotropic dilation converges to a vectorvalued function with regularity then the initial function must satisfy the strangfix conditions bivariate fractal interpolation functions on rectangular domains nontensor product bivariate fractal interpolation functions defined on gridded rectangular domains are constructed linear spaces consisting of these functions are introduced the relevant lagrange interpolation problem is discussed a negative result about the existence of affine fractal interpolation functions defined on such domains is obtained isogenous of the elliptic curves over the rationals an elliptic curve is a pair e o where e is a smooth projective curve of genus 1 and o is a point of e called the point at infinity every

rules and strategies for functionallogic programs this paper abstracts the contents of a phd dissertation entitled transformation rules and strategies for functionallogic programs which has been recently defended these techniques are based on foldunfold transformations and they can be used to optimize integrated functionallogic programs for a wide class of applications experimental results show that typical examples in the field of artificial intelligence are successfully enhanced by our transformation system synth the thesis presents the first approach of these methods for declarative languages that integrate the best features from functional and logic programming turning telecommunications call details to churn prediction a data mining approach as deregulation new technologies and new competitors open up the mobile telecommunications industry churn prediction and management has become of great concern to mobile service providers a mobile service provider wishing to retain its subscribers needs to be able to predict which of them may be atrisk of changing services and will make those subscribers the focus of customer retention efforts in response to the limitations of existing churnprediction systems and the unavailability of customer demographics in the mobile telecommunications provider investigated we propose design and experimentally evaluate a churnprediction technique that predicts churning from subscriber contractual information and call pattern changes extracted from call details this proposed technique is capable of identifying potential churners at the contract level for a specific prediction timeperiod in addition the proposed technique incorporates the multiclassifier classcombiner approach to address the challenge of a highly skewed class distribution between churners and nonchurners the empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed callbehaviorbased churnprediction technique exhibits satisfactory predictive effectiveness when more recent call details are employed for the churn prediction model construction furthermore the proposed technique is able to demonstrate satisfactory or reasonable predictive power within the onemonth interval between model construction and churn prediction using a previous demographicsbased churnprediction system as a reference the lift factors attained by our proposed technique appear largely satisfactory new developments in inductive learning any intelligent system whether natural or artificial must have three characteristics knowledge reasoning and learning artificial intelligence ai studies these three aspects in artificial systems briefly we could say that knowledge refers to the systems world model and reasoning to the manipulation of this knowledge learning is slightly more complex the system interacts with the world and as a consequence it builds onto and modifies its knowledge this process of selfbuilding and selfmodifying is known as learning this thesis is set within the field of artificial intelligence and focuses on learning more specifically it deals with the inductive learning of decision trees quadratic gauss sums over finite commutative rings this article explicitly determines the quadratic gauss sum over finite commutative rings the effects of technology on midcareer librarians this article investigates technology competency requirements in the library profession using the position advertisements in american libraries in fiveyear increments over a twentyyear period 19701990 the article examines and evaluates the advertised qualifications of positions and attempts to see if midcareer librariansespecially those who have achieved their degree prior to the change in mls curriculum that currently emphasizes technologyare effective librarians in the present and future job market happily ever after plateauing as a means for longterm career satisfaction little did i know when i attended judith bardwicks presentation on plateauing at the ala annual convention in 1988 that it would turn out to be one of the most valuable sessions i would attend at any library conference since it has enabled me to understand the phenomenon of plateauing and to use the strategies she suggested to rejuvenate my career and personal life continually key concepts and solutions from her book and from other literature on plateauing are summarized and examples given as to how i incorporated them into my life a work journal librarianship keeping a work journal can be useful in exploring ones thoughts and feelings about work challenges and work decisions it can help bring about greater fulfillment in ones work life by facilitating selfrenewal change the search for new meaning and job satisfaction one example of a work journal which i kept in 1998 is considered it touches on several issues of potential interest to midlife career librarians including the challenge of technology returning to work at midlife after raising a family further education professional writing and job exchange are we there yet facing the neverending speed and change of technology in midlife this essay is a personal reflection on entering librarianship in middle age at a time when the profession like society in general is experiencing rapidly accelerating change much of this change is due to the increased use of computers and information technologies in the library setting these aids in the production collection storage retrieval and dissemination of the collective information knowledge and sometimes wisdom of the past and the contemporary world can exhilarate or burden depending on ones worldview the organization and the flexibility of the workplace this writer finds herself working in a library where everyone is expected continually to explore and use new ways of working and providing library service to a campus and a wider community no time is spent in reflecting on what was but all efforts are to anticipate and prepare for what will be job rotation in an academic library damned if you do and damned if you dont this article considers job rotationthe systematic movement of employees from one job to anotheras one of the many tools within the organizational development tool kit there is a brief consideration of useful print and internet literature on the subject as well as a discussion of the pros and cons of job rotation the application of job rotation methods in ryerson university library a small academic library concludes the article in order to illustrate process and insights through example midlife career choices how are they different from other career choices it was 1963 when candy start began working in libraries libraries seemed to be a refuge from change a dependable environment devoted primarily to preservation she was mistaken technological changes in every decade of her experience have affected how and where she used her mls far from a static refuge libraries have proven to be spaceships loaded with precious cargo hurtling into the unknown the historian in the author says that perhaps libraries have always been like this this paper looks at a midlife decision point and the choice that this librarian made to move from a point of lessening productivity and interest to one of increasing challenge and contribution it is a personal narrative of midlife experience from one librarians point of view since writing this article candys career has followed more changes after selling the wings tm system she has taken her experiences and vision to another library vendor gaylord information systems where she serves as a senior product strategist helin pilot mentoring scheme the health care libraries unit coordinates facilitates and promotes continuing personal development for all staff in the health libraries and information network helin of the oxford deanery uk it supports the development of a culture of lifelong learning and recognizes that cpd should help deliver organizational objectives as well as enabling all staff to expand and fulfill their potential a major emphasis for 2000 was to investigate ways of improving support for individual learning within the workplace the group identified a need to build on existing informal support networks in order to provide additional learning opportunities and decided to investigate the feasibility of piloting a mentoring scheme the objectives of the pilot were to increase understanding and knowledge of mentoring as a tool for cpd to investigate existing mentoring schemes and their applicability for helin to develop a pilot mentoring scheme for helin incorporating a program for accreditation of mentors and to evaluate the scheme and disseminate the results in order to identify current practice in this area a literature review was carried out and colleagues with an interest in or existing knowledge of mentoring schemes were contacted where possible in the absence of clearly defined appraisal tools all abstracts were read and articles that met the following criteria were obtained and distributed to the group for review maybe its not too late to join the circus books for midlife career management midcareer librarians looking for career management help on the bookshelf face thousands of choices this article reviews thirteen popular career selfhelp books the reviewed books cover various aspects of career management and provide information on which might be best suited for particular goals including career change career tuneup and personal and professional selfevaluation the comments reflect issues of interest to midcareer professionals a parallelized indexing method for largescale casebased reasoning casebased reasoning cbr is a problem solving methodology commonly seen in artificial intelligence it can correctly take advantage of the situations and methods in former cases to find out suitable solutions for new problems cbr must accurately retrieve similar prior cases for getting a good performance in the past many researchers proposed useful technologies to handle this problem however the performance of retrieving similar cases may be greatly influenced by the number of cases in this paper the performance issue of largescale cbr is discussed and a parallelized indexing architecture is then proposed for efficiently retrieving similar cases in largescale cbr several algorithms for implementing the proposed architecture are also described some experiments are made and the results show the efficiency of the proposed method migrating to public librarianship depart on time to ensure a smooth flight career change can be a difficult timeconsuming and anxietyladen process for anyone contemplating this important decision the challenges faced by librarians considering the move from academic to public librarianship can be equally and significantly demanding to most outsiders at least on the surface it may appear to be a quick and easy transition to make but some professional librarians recognize the distinct differences between these areas of librarianship although the ubiquitous nature of technology has brought the various work responsibilities of academic and public librarians closer together during the last decade there remain key differences in jobrelated duties and the work environments these dissimilarities pose meaningful hurdles to leap for academic librarians wishing to migrate to the public sector the paper considers the variations between academic and public librarianship making it to the major leagues career movement between library and archival professions and from small college to large university libraries issues of career movement and change are examined between library and archival fields and from small colleges to large universities issues examined include professional education and training initial careerplanning and placement continuing education scouting and mentoring job market conditions work experience and personal skills professional involvement and professional association selfinterest this examination leads to five observations 1 it is easier in terms of career transitions for a librarian to become an archivist than it is for an archivist to become a librarian 2 the progression from a small college venue to a large research university is very manageable with the proper planning and experience 3 at least three of the career elementsprofessional education careerplanning and professional association selfinterestin their best moments provide a foundation that enables a future consideration of change between institutional types and professional areas and in their worst moments conspire against the midcareer professional in terms of change 4 the elements of scouting continuing education work experience and professional involvement offer the greatest assistance in career transitions 5 the job market is the wildcard that either stymies or stimulates occupational development exploring the sabbatical or other leave as a means of energizing a career this article challenges librarians to create leaves that will not only inspire professional growth but also renewal it presents a framework for developing a successful leave incorporating useful advice from librarians at concordia university montreal as food for thought the article offers examples of specific options meant to encourage professionals to explore their own creative ideas finally a central theme of this article is that a midlife leave provides one with the perfect opportunity to take stock of oneself in order to define future career directions midlife is a time when rebel forces feisty protestors from within often insist on being heard it is a time in other words when professionals often long to break loose from the stress to do far more in less time barner 1994 escaping from current job constraints into a world of creative endeavor when wellexecuted is a superb

june 2000 june 2001 the effect of a maleoriented computer gaming culture on careers in the computer industry if careers in the computer industry were viewed it would be evident that there is a conspicuous gender gap between the number of male and female employees the same gap can be observed at the college level where males are dominating females as to those who pursue and obtain a degree in computer science the question that this research paper intends to show is why are males so dominant when it comes to computer related matters the author has traced this question back to the computer game computer games are a fun medium and provide the means for an individual to become computer literate through the engagement of spatial learning and cognitive processing abilities since such games are marketed almost exclusively to males females have a distinct disadvantage males are more computer literate through the playing of computer games and are provided with an easy leadin to more advanced utilization of computers such as programming females tend to be turned off due to the male stereotypes and marketing associated with games and thus begins the gender gap a humane tool for aiding computer science advisors computer science students and parents over the past few years the computer science department faculty at baylor has observed that some students who perform adequately during the freshman and sophomore years have substantial difficulty during the junior and senior years of study baylor university is an institution committed to being caring of its students the objective for this study grew out of these two realities there are three objectives of this research one objective is to identify students no later than the sophomore year who are less likely to succeed as computer science majors a second objective is to accomplish this identification by using data from seniors majoring in computer science a third objective is to begin to use this information at the end of their sophomore year when meeting with a computer science faculty advisor a regression study is conducted on the data from all students classified as seniors majoring in computer science in may 2001 showing grades in six freshman and sophomore courses and showing grades for at least five junior or senior level computer science courses these students and their course performance data constituted the study sample the theory of information reversal the end of the industrial age coincides with the advent of the information society as the next model of social and economic organization which brings about significant changes in the way modern man conceives work and the social environment the functional basis of the new model is pivoted upon the effort to formulate the theory on the violent reversal of the basic relationship between man and information and isolate it as one of the components for the creation of the new electronic reality the objective of the theory of reversal is to effectively contribute to the formulation of a new definition consideration in regards to the concept of the emerging information society in order to empirically apply the theory of reversal we examine a case study based on the example of the digital library resolving web user on the fly identity authentication systems and procedures are rapidly becoming central issues in the practice and study of information systems development and security requirements for web transaction security wts include strong authentication of a user nonrepudiation and encryption of all traffic in this paper we present an effective mechanism involving two different channels which addresses the prime concerns involved in the security of electronic commerce transactions ect viz user authentication and nonrepudiation although the product is primarily targeted to provide a fillip to transactions carried out over the web this product can also be effectively used for noninternet transactions that are carried out where user authentication is required dousing terrorist funding mission possible banks the government is tightening its grip on terrorist money flows but as the banking industry continues to expand its patriot act compliance activities it is with the realization that a great deal of work remains to be done before the american financial system can become truly airtight identification instruments especially drivers licenses represent a significant weak spot documentbased workflow modeling a casebased reasoning approach a workflow model is useful for business process analysis a wellbuilt workflow can help a company streamline its internal processes by reducing overhead the results of workflow modeling need to be managed as information assets in a systematic fashion reusing these results is likely to enhance the quality of the modeling therefore this paper proposes a documentbased workflow modeling mechanism which employs a casebased reasoning cbr technique for the effective reuse of design outputs a repository is proposed to support this cbr process a reallife case is illustrated to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach copyright of electronic publishing with the spreading of the internet and the wide use of computers electronic publishing is becoming an indispensable measure to gain knowledge and skills meanwhile copyright is facing much more infringement than ever in this electronic environment so it is a key factor to effectively protect copyright of electronic publishing to foster the new publication fields the paper analyzes the importance of copyright the main causes for copyright infringement in electronic publishing and presents viewpoints on the definition and application of fair use of a copyrighted work and thinking of some means to combat breach of copyright the pedagogy of online learning a report from the university of the highlands and islands millennium institute authoritative sources concerned with computeraided learning resourcebased learning and online learning and teaching are generally agreed that in addition to subject matter expertise and technical support the quality of the learning materials and the learning experiences of students are critically dependent on the application of pedagogically sound theories of learning and teaching and principles of course design the university of the highlands and islands project uhimi is developing online learning on a large scale these developments have been accompanied by a comprehensive programme of staff development a major emphasis of the programme is concerned with ensuring that course developers and tutors are pedagogically aware this paper reviews i what is meant by online learning in the uhimi context ii the theories of learning and teaching and principles of course design that inform the staff development programme and iii a review of progress to date database technology in digital libraries database technology advancements have provided many opportunities for libraries these advancements can bring the world closer together through information accessibility digital library projects have been established worldwide to ultimately fulfil the needs of end users through more efficiency and convenience resource sharing will continue to be the trend for libraries changes often create issues which need to be addressed issues relating to database technology and digital libraries are reviewed some of the major challenges in digital libraries and managerial issues are identified as well the paradigm of viral communication the iiw institute of information management wwwiiwde is dealing with commercial applications of digital technologies such as the internet digital printing and many more a study which has been carried out by the institute identifies viral messages as a new paradigm of communication mostly found in the area of direct marketing and  who wonders  mainly within the usa viral messages underlie certain principles 1 prospects and customers of the idea are offered a technology platform providing a possibility to send a message to a majority of persons 2 there is an emotional or pecuniary incentive to participate ideally niches of needs and market vacua are filled with funny ideas 3 also the recipients are facing emotional or pecuniary incentives to contact a majority of further recipients  this induces a snowball effect and the message is spread virally and 4 the customer is activated as an ambassador of the piece of information for instance promoting a product or a company it is evident that there has been a long lasting history of what we call wordofmouth ever since however bundles of digital technologies empower the viral communication paradigm wellposed anisotropic diffusion for image denoising a nonlinear iterative smoothing filter based on a secondorder partial differential equation is introduced it smooths out the image according to an anisotropic diffusion process the approach is based on a smooth approximation of the total variation tv functional which overcomes the nondifferentiability of the tv functional at the origin in particular the authors perform linear smoothing over smooth areas but selective smoothing over candidate edges by relating the smoothing parameter to the time step they arrive at a cfl condition which guarantees the causality of the discrete scheme this allows the adoption of higher time discretisation steps while ensuring the absence of artefacts deriving from the nonsmooth behaviour of the tv functional at the origin in particular it is shown that the proposed approach avoids the typical staircase effects in smooth areas which occur in the standard timemarching tv scheme new voice over internet protocol technique with hierarchical data security protection the authors propose a voice over internet protocol voip technique with a new hierarchical data security protection hdsp scheme the proposed hdsp scheme can maintain the voice quality degraded from packet loss and preserve high data security it performs both the data interleaving on the interframe of voice for achieving better error recovery of voices suffering from continuous packet loss and the data encryption on the intraframe of voice for achieving high data security which are controlled by a random bitstring sequence generated from a chaotic system to demonstrate the performance of the proposed hdsp scheme we have successfully verified and analysed the proposed approach through software simulation and statistical measures on several test voices taylor series based twodimensional digital differentiators a new type of taylor series based 2d finite difference approximation is presented and it is shown that the coefficients of these approximations are not unique explicit formulas are presented for one of the possible sets of coefficients for an arbitrary order by extending the previously presented 1d approximations these coefficients are implemented as maximally linear 2d fir digital differentiators and their formulas are modified to narrow the inaccuracy regions on the resultant frequency responses close to the nyquist frequencies use of periodic and monotonic activation functions in multilayer feedforward neural networks trained by extended kalman filter algorithm the authors investigate the convergence and pruning performance of multilayer feedforward neural networks with different types of neuronal activation functions in solving various problems three types of activation functions are adopted in the network namely the traditional sigmoid function the sinusoidal function and a periodic function that can be considered as a combination of the first two functions to speed up the learning as well as to reduce the network size the extended kalman filter ekf algorithm conjunct with a pruning method is used to train the network the corresponding networks are applied to solve five typical problems namely 4point xor logic function parity generation handwritten digit recognition piecewise linear function approximation and sunspot series prediction simulation results show that periodic activation functions perform better than monotonic ones in solving multicluster classification problems moreover the combined periodic activation function is found to possess the fast convergence and multicluster classification capabilities of the sinusoidal activation function while keeping the robustness property of the sigmoid function required in the modelling of unknown systems robustness evaluation of a minimal rbf neural network for nonlineardatastoragechannel equalisation the authors present a performancerobustness evaluation of the recently developed minimal resource allocation network mran for equalisation in highly nonlinear magnetic recording channels in disc storage systems unlike communication systems equalisation of signals in these channels is a difficult problem as they are corrupted by datadependent noise and highly nonlinear distortions nair and moon 1997 have proposed a maximum signal to distortion ratio msdr equaliser for data storage channels which uses a specially designed neural network where all the parameters of the neural network are determined theoretically based on the exact knowledge of the channel model parameters in the present paper the performance of the msdr equaliser is compared with that of the mran equaliser using a magnetic recording channel model under conditions that include variations in partial erasure jitter width and noise power as well as model mismatch results from the study indicate that the less complex mran equaliser gives consistently better performance robustness than the msdr equaliser in terms of signal to distortion ratios sdrs steadystate meansquare error analysis of the crosscorrelation and constant modulus algorithm in a mimo convolutive system the crosscorrelation and constant modulus algorithm cccma has been proven to be an effective approach in the problem of joint blind equalisation and source separation in a multiinput and multioutput system in the paper the steadystate meansquare error performance of cccma in a noisefree environment is studied and a new expression is derived based on the energy preservation approach of mai and sayed 2000 simulation studies are undertaken to support the analysis differential and integral calculus on discrete time series data it has been found that discontinuity plays a crucial role in natural evolutions lin 1998 in this presentation we will generalize the idea of integration and differentiation we developed in calculus to the study of time series in the hope that the problem of outliers and discontinuities can be resolved more successfully than simply deleting the outliers and avoiding discontinuities from the overall data analysis in general appearances of outliers tend to mean existence of discontinuities explosive growth or decline in the evolution at the same time our approach can be employed to partially overcome the problem of not having enough data values in any available time series at the end we will look at some reallife problems of prediction in order to see the power of this new approach problems with my pda tom berry has lost his pda and now he has an even better understanding of the risks and benefits of working on the move multioutput regression using a locally regularised orthogonal leastsquares algorithm the paper considers data modelling using multioutput regression models a locally regularised orthogonal leastsquares lrols algorithm is proposed for constructing sparse multioutput regression models that generalise well by associating each regressor in the regression model with an individual regularisation parameter the ability of the multioutput orthogonal leastsquares ols model selection to produce a parsimonious model with a good generalisation performance is greatly enhanced least load dispatching algorithm for parallel web server nodes a least load dispatching algorithm for distributing requests to parallel web server nodes is described in this algorithm the load offered to a node by a request is estimated based on the expected transfer time of the corresponding reply through the internet this loading information is then used by the algorithm to identify the least load node of the web site by using this algorithm each request will always be sent for service at the earliest possible time performance comparison using nasa and clarknet access logs between the proposed algorithm and commonly used dispatching algorithms is performed the results show that the proposed algorithm gives 10 higher throughput than that of the commonly used random and roundrobin dispatching algorithms novel tcp congestion control scheme and its performance evaluation a novel selftuning proportional and derivative stpd control based tcp congestion control scheme is proposed the new scheme approaches the congestion control problem from a controltheoretical perspective and overcomes several important limitations associated with existing tcp congestion control schemes which are heuristic based in the proposed scheme a pd controller is employed to keep the buffer occupancy of the bottleneck node on the connection path at an ideal operating level and it adjusts the tcp window accordingly the control gains of the pd controller are tuned online by a fuzzy logic controller based on the perceived bandwidthdelay product of the tcp connection this scheme gives stpd tcp several advantages over current tcp implementations these include rapid response to bandwidth variations insensitivity to buffer sizes and significant improvement of tcp throughput over lossy links by decoupling congestion control and error control functions of tcp linear complexity of polyphase power residue sequences the well known family of binary legendre or quadratic residue sequences can be generalised to the multiplevalued case by employing a polyphase representation these pphase sequences with p prime also have prime length l and can be constructed from the index sequence of length l or equivalently from the cosets of pth power residues and nonresidues modulol the linear complexity of these polyphase sequences is derived and shown to fall into four classes depending on the value assigned to bsub 0 the initial digit of the sequence and on whether p belongs to the set of pth power residues or not the characteristic polynomials of the linear feedback shift registers that generate these sequences are also derived module placement with boundary constraints using btrees the module placement problem is to determine the coordinates of logic modules in a chip such that no two modules overlap and some cost eg silicon area interconnection length etc is optimised to shorten connections between inputs and outputs andor make related modules adjacent it is desired to place some modules along the specific boundaries of a chip to deal with such boundary constraints we explore the feasibility conditions of a btree with boundary constraints and develop a simulated annealingbased algorithm using btrees unlike most previous work the proposed algorithm guarantees a feasible btree with boundary constraints for each perturbation experimental results show that the algorithm can obtain a smaller silicon area than the most recent work based on sequence pairs exact analytical model for the aep of control signals an exact analytical model for the aliasing error probability aep in the signature analysis of control signals using a modified signature analyser is presented the signature analyser used comprises a generalstructure twoinput compacting module ticm which simplifies the motherboard vlsi design by providing a flexible geometry which could be easily integrated with neighbouring structures the use of the modified data probe eliminates the ambiguity introduced by the highimpedance state and at the same time retains the same signature of the binary stream the model specifies algebraically the effects of the ticm architecture the test pattern length and the control stream error probabilities it is proved that the hardware criterion used for calculating the aep for the internal and external exclusiveor twoinput shift registers is not valid for the general case and a new criterion is provided the results obtained are augmented by two special cases a case study and associated simulation fast and efficient algorithm for the multiplierless realisation of linear dsp transforms a fast algorithm having a pseudopolynomial runtime and memory requirement in the worst case is developed to generate multiplierless architectures at all wordlengths for constant multiplications in linear dsp transforms it is also reemphasised that indefinitely reducing operators for multiplierless architectures is not sufficient to reduce the final chip area for a major reduction techniques like resource folding must be used simple techniques for improving the results are also presented regional flux target with minimum energy an extension of a gradient controllability problem to the case where the target subregion is a part of the boundary of a parabolic system domain is discussed a definition and some properties adapted to this case are presented the focus is on the characterisation of the control achieving a regional boundary gradient target with minimum energy an approach is developed that leads to a numerical algorithm for the computation of optimal control numerical illustrations show the efficiency of the approach and lead to conjectures nonlinearities in narx polynomial models representation and estimation it is shown how nonlinearities are mapped in narx polynomial models general expressions are derived for the gain and eigenvalue functions in terms of the regressors and coefficients of narx models such relationships are useful in greybox identification problems the results are illustrated using simulated and real data approach to adaptive neural netbased hsub infinity  control design an approach is investigated for the adaptive neural netbased hsub infinity  control design of a class of nonlinear uncertain systems in the proposed framework two multilayer feedforward neural networks are constructed as an alternative to approximate the nonlinear system the neural networks are piecewisely interpolated to generate a linear differential inclusion model by which a linear state feedback hsub infinity  control law can be applied an adaptive weight adjustment mechanism for the multilayer feedforward neural networks is developed to ensure hsub infinity  regulation performance it is shown that finding the control gain matrices can be transformed into a standard linear matrix inequality problem and solved via a developed recurrent neural network electromagnetics computations using the mpi parallel implementation of the steepest descent fast multipole method sdfmm the computational solution of largescale linear systems of equations necessitates the use of fast algorithms but is also greatly enhanced by employing parallelization techniques the objective of this work is to demonstrate the speedup achieved by the mpi message passing interface parallel implementation of the steepest descent fast multipole method sdfmm although this algorithm has already been optimized to take advantage of the structure of the physics of scattering problems there is still the opportunity to speed up the calculation by dividing tasks into components using multiple processors and solve them in parallel the sdfmm has three bottlenecks ordered as 1 filling the sparse impedance matrix associated with the nearfield method of moments interactions mom 2 the matrix vector multiplications associated with this sparse matrix and 3 the far field interactions associated with the fast multipole method the parallel implementation task is accomplished using a thirtyone node intel pentium beowulf cluster and is also validated on a 4processor alpha workstation the beowulf cluster consists of thirtyone nodes of 350 mhz intel pentium iis with 256 mb of ram and one node of a 4450 mhz intel pentium ii xeon shared memory processor with 2 gb of ram with all nodes connected to a 100 basetx ethernet network the alpha workstation has a maximum of four 667 mhz processors our numerical results show significant linear speedup in filling the sparse impedance matrix using the 32processors on the beowulf cluster lead to a 72 overall speedup while a 25 overall speedup is gained using the 4processors on the alpha workstation inputoutput based poleplacement controller for a class of timedelay systems a controller structure valid for siso plants involving both internal and external point delays is presented the control signal is based only on the input and output plant signals the controller allows finite or infinite spectrum assignment the most important feature of the proposed controller is that it only involves the use of a class of pointdelayed signals thus the controller synthesis involves less computational cost than former methods since the plant control input is generated by filtering the input and output plant signals this controller structure is potentially applicable to the adaptive case of unknown plant parameters adaptive tracking controller design for robotic systems using gaussian wavelet networks an adaptive tracking control design for robotic systems using gaussian wavelet networks is proposed a gaussian wavelet network with accurate approximation capability is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics of robotic systems by using an adaptive learning algorithm that can learn the parameters of the dilation and translation of gaussian wavelet functions depending on the finite number of wavelet basis functions which result in inevitable approximation errors a robust control law is provided to guarantee the stability of the closedloop robotic system that can be proved by lyapunov theory finally the effectiveness of the gaussian wavelet networkbased control approach is illustrated through comparative simulations on a sixlink robot manipulator computing the frequency response of systems affinely depending on uncertain parameters the computation of the frequency response of systems depending affinely on uncertain parameters can be reduced to that of all its onedimensional edge plants while the image of such an edge plant at a fixed frequency is an arc or a line segment in the complex plane based on this conclusion four computational formulas of the maximal and minimal maximini magnitudes and phases of an edge plant at a fixed frequency are given the formulas besides sharing a simpler form of expression concretely display how the extrema of the frequency response of the edge plant relate to the typical characteristics of the arc and line segment such as the centre radius and tangent points of the arc the distance from the origin to the line segment etc the direct application of the results is to compute the bode nichols and nyquistplot collections of the systems which are needed in robustness analysis and design lmi approach to digital redesign of linear timeinvariant systems a simple design methodology for the digital redesign of static state feedback controllers by using linear matrix inequalities is presented the proposed method provides close matching of the states between the original continuoustime system and those of the digitally redesigned system with a guaranteed stability specifically the digital redesign problem is reformulated as linear matrix inequalities lmis and solved by a numerical optimisation technique the main feature of the proposed method is that the closedloop stability of the digitally redesigned system is explicitly guaranteed within the design procedure using the lmibased approach a numerical example of the position control of a simple crane system is presented control of integral processes with deadtime 2 quantitative analysis for part 1 see ibid p28590 2002 several different control schemes for integral processes with dead time resulted in the same disturbance response it has already been shown that such a response is subideal hence it is necessary to quantitatively analyse the achievable specifications and the robust stability regions the control parameter can be quantitatively determined with a compromise between the disturbance response and the robustness four specifications normalised maximum dynamic error maximum decay rate normalised control action bound and approximate recovery time are used to characterise the stepdisturbance response it is shown that any attempt to obtain a normalised dynamic error less than tau sub m is impossible and a sufficient condition on the relative gainuncertainty bound is square root 32 control of integral processes with deadtime 1 disturbance observerbased 2 dof control scheme a disturbance observerbased control scheme a version of 2 dof internal model control which is very effective in controlling integral processes with dead time is presented the controller can be designed to reject ramp disturbances as well as step disturbances and even arbitrary disturbances when the plant model is available only two parameters are left to tune one is the time constant of the setpoint response and the other is the time constant of the disturbance response the latter is tuned according to the compromise between disturbance response and robustness this control scheme has a simple clear easytodesign easytoimplement structure and good performance it is compared to the best results so far using some simulation examples hamiltonian modelling and nonlinear disturbance attenuation control of tcsc for improving power system stability to tackle the obstacle of applying passivitybased control pbc to power systems an affine nonlinear system widely existing in power systems is formulated as a standard hamiltonian system using a prefeedback method the port controlled hamiltonian with dissipation pchd model of a thyristor controlled serial compensator tcsc is then established corresponding with a revised hamiltonian function furthermore employing the modified hamiltonian function directly as the storage function a nonlinear adaptive lsub 2 gain control method is proposed to solve the problem of lsub 2 gain disturbance attenuation for this hamiltonian system with parametric perturbations finally simulation results are presented to verify the validity of the proposed controller nonlinear adaptive control via slidingmode state and perturbation observer the paper presents a nonlinear adaptive controller nac for singleinput singleoutput feedback linearisable nonlinear systems a slidingmode state and perturbation observer is designed to estimate the system states and perturbation which includes the combined effect of system nonlinearities uncertainties and external disturbances the nac design does not require the details of the nonlinear system model and full system states it possesses an adaptation capability to deal with system parameter uncertainties unmodelled system dynamics and external disturbances the convergence of the observer and the stability analysis of the controllerobserver system are given the proposed control scheme is applied for control of a synchronous generator in comparison with a statefeedback linearising controller flc simulation study is carried out based on a singlegenerator infinitebus power system to show the performance of the controllerobserver system slidingmode control scheme for a class of continuous chemical reactors the synthesis of a robust control law for regulation control of a class of relativedegreeone nonlinear systems is presented the control design is based on a slidingmode uncertainty estimator developed under a framework of algebraicdifferential concepts the closedloop stability for the underlying closedloop system is achieved via averaging techniques robustness of the proposed control scheme is proved in the face of noise measurements model uncertainties and sustained disturbances the performance of the proposed control law is illustrated with numerical simulations comparing the proposed controller with a well tuned pi controller structural interpretation of matched polezero discretisation deals with matched polezero discretisation which has been used in practice for hand calculations in the digital redesign of continuoustime systems but available only in the transferfunction form since this form is inconvenient for characterising the timedomain properties of sampleddata loops and for computerising the design of such systems a statespace formulation is developed under the new interpretation the matched polezero model is shown to be structurally identical to a holdequivalent discretetime model where the generalised hold takes integral part thus unifying the most widely used discretisation approaches an algorithm for obtaining the generalised hold function is presented the holdequivalent structure of the matched polezero model clarifies several discretetime system properties such as controllability and observability and their preservation or loss with a matched polezero discretisation with the proposed formulation the matched polezero holdequivalent and mapping models can now all be constructed with a single schematic model phase transition for parking blocks brownian excursion and coalescence in this paper we consider hashing with linear probing for a hashing table with m places n items nm and lmn empty places for a noncomputer scienceminded reader we shall use the metaphore of n cars parking on m places each car csub i chooses a place psub i at random and if psub i is occupied csub i tries successively psub i1 psub i2 until it finds an empty place pittel 42 proves that when lm goes to some positive limit beta 1 the size bsub 1sup ml of the largest block of consecutive cars satisfies 2 beta 1log beta  bsub 1sup ml2 log m3 log log m xi sub m where xi sub m converges weakly to an extremevalue distribution in this paper we examine at which level for n a phase transition occurs between bsub 1sup mlom and mbsub 1sup mlom the intermediate case reveals an interesting behavior of sizes of blocks related to the standard additive coalescent in the same way as the sizes of connected components of the random graph are related to the multiplicative coalescent fast accurate and stable simulation of power electronic systems using virtual resistors and capacitors simulation of power electronic circuits remains a problem due to the high level of stiffness brought about by the modelling of switches as biresistors ie very low turnon resistance and very high turnoff resistance the merits and drawbacks of two modelling methods that address this problem are discussed a modelling solution for ensuring numerically stable accurate and fast simulation of power electronic systems is proposed the solution enables easy connectivity between power electronic elements in the simulation model it involves the modelling of virtual capacitance at switching nodes to soften voltage discontinuity due to the switch current suddenly going to zero undesirable ringing effects that may arise due to the interaction between the virtual capacitance and circuit inductance are eliminated by modelling virtual damping resistors in parallel to inductors that are adjacent to switching elements a midpoint configuration method is also introduced for modelling shunt capacitors a dc traction system is simulated using this modelling strategy and the results are included simulation results obtained using this modelling strategy are validated by comparison with the established mesh analysis technique of modelling the simulation performance is also compared with the power system blockset commercial software performance design and control of a seriesparallel clsup 2type resonant dcdc converter the threeelement resonant network has various topological alternatives one of which a prospective compound topology is investigated in detail the converter uses one capacitor c and two inductors lsup 2 to form a compound type clsup 2 network various advantages and limitations of the converter are detailed and a new design procedure for such converters is also introduced the converter may be controlled by varying the switching frequency or by pulsewidth modulation an experimental prototype has been produced and an excellent performance in the lagging powerfactor mode has been confirmed singlephase halfbridge converter topology for power quality compensation a high power factor halfbridge rectifier with neutral point switch clamped scheme is proposed three power switches are employed in the proposed rectifier two pwm control schemes are used to draw a sinusoidal line current with low current distortion the control signals of the power switches are derived from the dc link voltage balance compensator line current controller and dc link voltage regulator the hysteresis current control scheme is employed to track the line current command the proposed control scheme and the circuit configuration can be applied to the active power filter to eliminate the harmonic currents and compensate the reactive power generated from the nonlinear load analytical and experimental results are included to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme singlephase shunt active power filter with harmonic detection an advanced active power filter for the compensation of instantaneous harmonic current components in nonlinear current loads is presented a signal processing technique using an adaptive neural network algorithm is applied for the detection of harmonic components generated by nonlinear current loads and it can efficiently determine the instantaneous harmonic components in real time the validity of this active filtering processing system to compensate current harmonics is substantiated by simulation results parallel operation of capacitylimited threephase fourwire active power filters threephase fourwire active power filters apfs are presented that can be paralleled to enlarge the system capacity and reliability the apf employs the pwm fourleg voltagesource inverter a decoupling control approach for the leg connected to the neutral line is proposed such that the switching of all legs has no interaction functions of the proposed apf include compensation of reactive power harmonic current unbalanced power and zerosequence current of the load the objective is to achieve unity power factor balanced line current and zero neutralline current compensation of all components is capacitylimited cooperating with the cascaded load current sensing scheme multiple apfs can be paralleled to share the load power without requiring any control interconnection in addition to providing the theoretic bases and detailed design of the apfs two 6 kva apfs are implemented the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with experimental results fuzzy logic controlled shunt active power filter for power quality improvement the simulation and experimental study of a fuzzy logic controlled threephase shunt active power filter to improve power quality by compensating harmonics and reactive power required by a nonlinear load is presented the advantage of fuzzy control is that it is based on a linguistic description and does not require a mathematical model of the system the fuzzy control scheme is realised on an inexpensive dedicated microcontroller intel 8031 based system the compensation process is based on sensing line currents only an approach different from conventional methods which require harmonics or reactive voltampere requirement of the load the performance of the fuzzy logic controller is compared with a conventional pi controller the dynamic behavior of the fuzzy controller is found to be better than the conventional pi controller pwm pattern generation is based on carrierless hysteresis based current control to obtain the switching signals various simulation and experimental results are presented under steady state and transient conditions modeling shape and topology of lowresolution density maps of biological macromolecules we develop an efficient way of representing the geometry and topology of volumetric datasets of biological structures from medium to low resolution aiming at storing and querying them in a database framework we make use of a new vector quantization algorithm to select the points within the macromolecule that best approximate the probability density function of the original volume data connectivity among points is obtained with the use of the alpha shapes theory this novel data representation has a number of interesting characteristics such as 1 it allows us to automatically segment and quantify a number of important structural features from lowresolution maps such as cavities and channels opening the possibility of querying large collections of maps on the basis of these quantitative structural features 2 it provides a compact representation in terms of size 3 it contains a subset of threedimensional points that optimally quantify the densities of medium resolution data and 4 a general model of the geometry and topology of the macromolecule as opposite to a spatially unrelated bunch of voxels is easily obtained by the use of the alpha shapes theory gossip is synteny incomplete gossip and the syntenic distance between genomes the syntenic distance between two genomes is given by the minimum number of fusions fissions and translocations required to transform one into the other ignoring the order of genes within chromosomes computing this distance is nphard in the present work we give a tight connection between syntenic distance and the incomplete gossip problem a novel generalization of the classical gossip problem in this problem there are n gossipers each with a unique piece of initial information they communicate by phone calls in which the two participants exchange all their information the goal is to minimize the total number of phone calls necessary to inform each gossiper of his set of relevant gossip which he desires to learn as an application of the connection between syntenic distance and incomplete gossip we derive an o2sup on log n algorithm to exactly compute the syntenic distance between two genomes with at most n chromosomes each our algorithm requires onsup 22sup od log d time when this distance is d improving the onsup 22odsup 2 running time of the best previous exact algorithm exploiting structure in quantified formulas we study the computational problem find the value of the quantified formula obtained by quantifying the variables in a sum of terms the sum can be based on any commutative monoid the quantifiers need only satisfy two simple conditions and the variables can have any finite domain this problem is a generalization of the problem given a sumofproducts of terms find the value of the sum studied by re stearns and hb hunt iii 1996 a data structure called a structure tree is defined which displays information about subproblems that can be solved independently during the process of evaluating the formula some formulas have good structure trees which enable certain generic algorithms to evaluate the formulas in significantly less time than by brute force evaluation by generic algorithm we mean an algorithm constructed from uninterpreted function symbols quantifier symbols and monoid operations the algebraic nature of the model facilitates a formal treatment of local reductions based on the local replacement of terms such local reductions preserve formula structure in the sense that structure trees with nice properties transform into structure trees with similar properties these local reductions can also be used to transform hierarchical specified problems with useful structure into hierarchically specified problems having similar structure improved approximation of maxcut on graphs of bounded degree let alpha approximately087856 denote the best approximation ratio currently known for the maxcut problem on general graphs we consider a semidefinite relaxation of the maxcut problem round it using the random hyperplane rounding technique of mx goemans and dp williamson 1995 and then add a local improvement step we show that for graphs of degree at most delta  our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of at least alpha  epsilon  where epsilon 0 is a constant that depends only on delta  using computer assisted analysis we show that for graphs of maximal degree 3 our algorithm obtains an approximation ratio of at least 0921 and for 3regular graphs the approximation ratio is at least 0924 we note that for the semidefinite relaxation of maxcut used by goemans and williamson the integrality gap is at least 10885 even for 2regular graphs asymptotic analysis of 3 2 1shell sort we analyze the 3 2 1shell sort algorithm under the usual random permutation model approximation of pathwidth of outerplanar graphs there exists a polynomial time algorithm to compute the pathwidth of outerplanar graphs but the large exponent makes this algorithm impractical in this paper we give an algorithm that given a biconnected outerplanar graph g finds a path decomposition of g of pathwidth at most twice the pathwidth of g plus one to obtain the result several relations between the pathwidth of a biconnected outerplanar graph and its dual are established fast broadcasting and gossiping in radio networks we establish an on logsup 2 n upper bound on the time for deterministic distributed broadcasting in multihop radio networks with unknown topology this nearly matches the known lower bound of omega n log n the fastest previously known algorithm for this problem works in time onsup 32 using our broadcasting algorithm we develop an onsup 32 logsup 2 n algorithm for gossiping in the same network model a linear time algorithm for recognizing regular boolean functions a positive or monotone boolean function is regular if its variables are naturally ordered left to fight by decreasing strength so that shifting the nonzero component of any true vector to the left always yields another true vector this paper considers the problem of recognizing whether a positive function f is regular where f is given by min tf the set of all minimal true vectors of f we propose a simple linear time ie onmin tftime algorithm for it this improves upon the previous algorithm by js provan and mo ball 1988 which requires onsup 2min tf time as a corollary we also present an onnmin tftime algorithm for the recognition problem of 2monotonic functions british standard 7666 as a framework for geocoding land and property information the uk the article examines the role of british standard 7666 in the development of a national framework for geocoding land and property information in the united kingdom the author assesses how local authorities and other agencies concerned with property and address datasets are coping with the introduction of british standard 7666 and examines the prospects and limitations of this development british standard 7666 has four parts comprising specifications for street gazetteer land and property gazetteer addresses and public rights of way the organisation coordinating the introduction of british standard 7666 improvement and development agency idea is also overseeing the development and maintenance of a national land and property gazetteer nlpg based on british standard 7666 the introduction of the new addressing standard has mainly been prompted by britains effort to set up a national cadastral service to replace the obsolescent property registration system currently in place a formal model of correctness in a cadastre a key issue for cadastral systems is the maintenance of their correctness correctness is defined to be the proper correspondence between the valid legal situation and the content of the cadastre this correspondence is generally difficult to achieve since the cadastre is not a complete representation of all aspects influencing the legal situation in reality the goal of the paper is to develop a formal model comprising representations of the cadastre and of reality that allows the simulation and investigation of cases where this correspondence is potentially violated for this purpose the model consists of two parts the first part represents the valid legal situation and the second part represents the cadastre this makes it feasible to mark the differences between reality and the cadastre the marking together with the two parts of the model facilitate the discussion of issues in realworld cadastral systems where incorrectness occurs in order to develop a formal model the paper uses the transfer of ownership of a parcel between two persons as minimal case study the foundation for the formalization is a modern version of the situation calculus the focus moves from the analysis of the cadastre to the preparation of a conceptual and a formalized model and the implementation of a prototype establishing an urban digital cadastre analytical reconstruction of parcel boundaries a new method for generating a spatially accurate legally supportive and operationally efficient cadastral database of the urban cadastral reality is described the definition and compilation of an accurate cadastral database achieving a standard deviation smaller than 01 m is based on an analytical reconstruction of cadastral boundaries rather than on the conventional field reconstruction process the new method is based on gps control points and traverse networks for providing the framework the old field books for defining the links between the various original ground features and a geometrical and cadastral adjustment process as the conceptual basis a pilot project that was carried out in order to examine and evaluate the new method is described parcel boundary identification with computerassisted boundary overlay process for taiwan the study investigates the design of a process for parcel boundary identification with cadastral map overlay using the principle of least squares the objective of this research is to provide an objective tool for boundary identification survey the proposed process includes an adjustment model a weighting scheme and other related operations a numerical example is included a review of methodologies used in research on cadastral development worldwide much attention has been given to cadastral development as a consequence of experiences made during recent decades several authors have stated the need for research in the domain of cadastre and proposed methodologies to be used the paper contributes to the acceptance of research methodologies needed for cadastral development and thereby enhances theory in the cadastral domain the paper reviews nine publications on cadastre and identifies the methodologies used the review focuses on the institutional social political and economic aspects of cadastral development rather than on the technical aspects the main conclusion is that the methodologies used are largely those of the social sciences that agrees with the notion that cadastre relates as much to people and institutions as it relates to land and that cadastral systems are shaped by social political and economic conditions as well as technology since the geodetic survey profession has been the keeper of the cadastre geodetic surveyors will have to deal ever more with social science matters a fact that universities will have to consider anticipating the further development of cadastral systems although the paper recognises the merits of the evolution of cadastral systems towards an increased capability over time it promotes a radical introduction or overhaul of existing cadastral systems it encourages the development of a capability to cope with some key drivers of major change these have been identified as globalisation the advent of fully automated cadastral environments improved decentralised methods of governance and greatly improved service delivery of future cadastral systems to a wide range of users the paper promotes the registration of title supported by government guarantee as an effective means for rapidly introducing cadastral systems to facilitate globally competitive land markets in developing countries in developing automated environments for cadastral systems the need to completely reengineer and redesign cadastral systems to meet basic cadastral principles and responsiveness to individual user needs is promoted in this environment highly decentralised cadastral operations and administration combined with light regulatory control are advocated as a future governance strategy with regard to the level of services to users an emphasis on recognising and serving the future needs of users is seen as essential international and national professional and user organisations involved in land administration are seen as an important vehicle for developing strategies and providing evaluation to guide the overarching development of cadastral systems around the world the dynamic aspect of land administration an oftenforgotten component in system design although the establishment of a land administration system is enough of a challenge as it is the task of keeping the system up to date with developments in society is even more challenging initial adjudication and cadastral mapping basically record land tenure as it exists at a given moment ie the static situation the paper aims to analyse the developments that might occur in a society with respect to tenure value and use of land these developments constitute a dynamic component of land administration as land administration systems have to serve society on a longterm basis and normally have a longterm return on investment the author recommends taking into account both the static and dynamic component when designing land administration systems on the expected value of the minimum assignment the minimum kassignment of an mn matrix x is the minimum sum of k entries of x no two of which belong to the same row or column coppersmith and sorkin conjectured that if x is generated by choosing each entry independently from the exponential distribution with mean 1 then the expected value of its minimum kassignment is given by an explicit formula which has been proven only in a few cases in this paper we describe our efforts to prove the coppersmithsorkin conjecture by considering the more general situation where the entries xsub ij of x are chosen independently from different distributions in particular we require that xsub ij be chosen from the exponential distribution with mean 1rsub icsub j we conjecture an explicit formula for the expected value of the minimum kassignment of such x and give evidence for this formula too much middleware the movement from clientserver computing to multitier computing has created a potpourri of socalled middleware systems including application servers workflow products eai systems etl systems and federated data systems we argue that the explosion in middleware has created a myriad of poorly integrated systems with overlapping functionality the world would be well served by considerable consolidation and we present some of the ways this might happen some of the points covered in the article have been previously explored by p bernstein 1996 the xml typechecking problem when an xml document conforms to a given type eg a dtd or an xml schema type it is called a valid document checking if a given xml document is valid is called the validation problem and is typically performed by a parser hence validating parser more precisely it is performed right after parsing by the same program module in practice however xml documents are often generated dynamically by some program checking whether all xml documents generated by the program are valid wrt a given type is called the typechecking problem while a validation analyzes an xml document a type checker analyzes a program and the problems difficulty is a function of the language in which that program is expressed the xml typechecking problem has been investigated recently and the xquery working group adopted some of these techniques for typechecking xquery all these techniques however have limitations which need to be understood and further explored and investigated we define the xml typechecking problem and present current approaches to typechecking discussing their limitations the role of b2b engines in b2b integration architectures semantic b2b integration architectures must enable enterprises to communicate standardsbased b2b events like purchase orders with any potential trading partner this requires not only back end application integration capabilities to integrate with eg enterprise resource planning erp systems as the companyinternal source and destination of b2b events but also a capability to implement every necessary b2b protocol like electronic data interchange edi rosettanet as well as more generic capabilities like web services ws this paper shows the placement and functionality of b2b engines in semantic b2b integration architectures that implement a generic framework for modeling and executing any b2b protocol a detailed discussion shows how a b2b engine can provide the necessary abstractions to implement any standardbased b2b protocol or any trading partner specific specialization supply chain infrastructures system integration and information sharing the need for supply chain integration sci methodologies has been increasing as a consequence of the globalization of production and sales and the advancement of enabling information technologies in this paper we describe our experience with implementing and modeling scis we present the integration architecture and the software components of our prototype implementation we then discuss a variety of information sharing methodologies then within the framework of a multiechelon supply chain process model spanning multiple organizations we summarize research on the benefits of intraorganizational knowledge sharing and we discuss performance scalability a multiagent system infrastructure for software component marketplace an ontological perspective in this paper we introduce a multiagent system architecture and an implemented prototype for a software component marketplace we emphasize the ontological perspective by discussing ontology modeling for the component marketplace uml extensions for ontology modeling and the idea of ontology transfer which makes the multiagent system adapt itself to dynamically changing ontologies business data management for businesstobusiness electronic commerce businesstobusiness electronic commerce b2b ec opens up new possibilities for trade for example new business partners from around the globe can be found their offers can be compared even complex negotiations can be conducted electronically and a contract can be drawn up and fulfilled via an electronic marketplace however sophisticated data management is required to provide such facilities in this paper the results of a multinational project on creating a businesstobusiness electronic marketplace for small and mediumsized enterprises are presented tools for information discovery protocolbased negotiations and monitored contract enactment are provided and based on a business data repository the repository integrates heterogeneous business data with business communication specific problems such as multilingual nature data ownership and traceability of contracts and related negotiations are addressed and it is shown that the present approach provides efficient business data management for b2b ec semantic b2b integration issues in ontologybased approaches solving queries to support ecommerce transactions can involve retrieving and integrating information from multiple information resources often users dont care which resources are used to answer their query in such situations the ideal solution would be to hide from the user the details of the resources involved in solving a particular query an example would be providing seamless access to a set of heterogeneous electronic product catalogues there are many problems that must be addressed before such a solution can be provided in this paper we discuss a number of these problems indicate how we have addressed these and go on to describe the proofofconcept demonstration system we have developed conceptual modeling and specification generation for b2b business processes based on ebxml in order to support dynamic setup of business processes among independent organizations a formal standard schema for describing the business processes is basically required the ebxml framework provides such a specification schema called bpss business process specification schema which is available in two standalone representations a uml version and an xml version the former however is not intended for the direct creation of business process specifications but for defining specification elements and their relationships required for creating an ebxmlcompliant business process specification for this reason it is very important to support conceptual modeling that is well organized and directly matched with major modeling concepts this paper deals with how to represent and manage b2b business processes using umlcompliant diagrams the major challenge is to organize uml diagrams in a natural way that is well suited to the business process metamodel and then to transform the diagrams into an xml version this paper demonstrates the usefulness of conceptually modeling business processes by prototyping a business process editor tool called ebdesigner contracting in the days of ebusiness putting electronic business on a sound foundationmodel theoretically as well as technologicallyis a central challenge for research as well as commercial development this paper concentrates on the discovery and negotiation phase of concluding an agreement based on a contract we present a methodology for moving seamlessly from a manytomany relationship in the discovery phase to a onetoone relationship in the contract negotiation phase making the content of contracts persistent is achieved by reconstructing contract templates by means of mereologic logic of the wholepart relation possibly nested substructures of the contract template are taken as a basis for negotiation in a dialogical way for the negotiation itself the contract templates are extended by implications logical and sequences topical an active functionality service for ebusiness applications service based architectures are a powerful approach to meet the fast evolution of business rules and the corresponding software an active functionality service that detects events and involves the appropriate business rules is a critical component of such a servicebased middleware architecture in this paper we present an active functionality service that is capable of detecting events in heterogeneous environments it uses an integral ontologybased approach for the semantic interpretation of heterogeneous events and data and provides notifications through a publishsubscribe notification mechanism the power of this approach is illustrated with the help of an auction application and through the personalization of car and driver portals in internetenabled vehicles property testers for dense constraint satisfaction programs on finite domains many nphard languages can be decided in subexponential time if the definition of decide is relaxed only slightly rubinfeld and sudan introduced the notion of property testers probabilistic algorithms that can decide with high probability if a function has a certain property or if it is far from any function having this property goldreich goldwasser and ron constructed property testers with constant query complexity for dense instances of a large class of graph problems since many graph problems can be viewed as special cases of the constraint satisfaction problem on boolean domains it is natural to try to construct property testers for more general cases of the constraint satisfaction problem in this paper we give explicit constructions of property testers using a constant number of queries for dense instances of constraint satisfaction problems where the constraints have constant arity and the variables assume values in some domain of finite size the ntier hub technology during 2001 the enterprise engineering laboratory at george mason university was contracted by the boeing company to develop an ehub capability for aerospace suppliers in taiwan in a laboratory environment the core technology was designed developed and tested and now a large firsttier aerospace supplier in taiwan is commercializing the technology the project objective was to provide layered network and application services for transporting xmlbased business transaction flows across multitier heterogeneous data processing environments this paper documents the business scenario the ehub application and the network transport mechanisms that were used to build the ntier hub in contrast to most ehubs this solution takes the point of view of suppliers pushing data in accordance with supplier requirements hence enhancing the probability of supplier adoption the unique contribution of this project is the development of an ehub that meets the needs of small and medium enterprises smes and firsttier suppliers supporting global user profiles through trusted authorities personalization generally refers to making a web site more responsive to the unique and individual needs of each user we argue that for personalization to work effectively detailed and interoperable user profiles should be globally available for authorized sites and these profiles should dynamically reflect changes in user interests creating user profiles from user clickstream data seems to be an effective way of generating detailed and dynamic user profiles however a user profile generated in this way is available only on the computer where the user accesses his browser and is inaccessible when the same user works on a different computer on the other hand integration of the internet with telecommunication networks has made it possible for the users to connect to the web with a variety of mobile devices as well as desktops this requires that user profiles should be available to any desktop or mobile device on the internet that users choose to work with in this paper we address these problems through the concept of trusted authority a user agent at the client side that captures the user click stream dynamically generates a navigational history log file in extensible markup language xml this log file is then used to produce user profiles in a resource description framework rdf a users right to privacy is provided through the platform for privacy preferences p3p standard user profiles are uploaded to the trusted authority and served next time the user connects to the web the design and performance evaluation of alternative xml storage strategies this paper studies five strategies for storing xml documents including one that leaves documents in the file system three that use a relational database system and one that uses an object manager we implement and evaluate each approach using a number of xquery queries a number of interesting insights are gained from these experiments and a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches is

can be great the key is knowing when to focus and when to partner technology in distance education a global perspective to alternative delivery mechanisms technology is providing a positive impact on delivery mechanisms employed in distance education at the university level some institutions are incorporating distance education as a way to extend the classroom other institutions are investigating new delivery mechanisms which support a revised perspective on education these latter institutions are revising their processes for interacting with students and taking a more learner centered approach to the delivery of education this article discusses the impact of technology on the delivery mechanisms employed in distance education a framework is proposed here which presents a description of alternative modes of generic delivery mechanisms it is suggested that those institutions which adopt a delivery mechanism employing an asynchronous mode can gain the most benefit from technology this approach seems to represent the only truly innovative use of technology in distance education the approach creates a studentoriented environment while maintaining high levels of interaction both of which are factors that contribute to student satisfaction with their overall educational experience global comparison of stages of growth based on critical success factors with

emerged from the peripheral aspects of the finance department to the centre of critical organisational change there is an increasing dependency on its activities as systems extend beyond supporting the internal efficiency of the organisation to augmenting global performance the growth of wide and local networks has resulted in communication possibilities that were not possible a few years ago ecommerce challenges the achievements of the isit function and is very prominent in the globalisation of modern organisations the complexity and diversity of electronic exchange is also well documented hackney et al 2000 this has a number of impacts on the development and implementation of isit solutions for organisations involved in international trade it is a conjecture that the isit function is critically important for the alignment of the business to meet the demands of global competition through building internal marketing strategies and creating knowledge based communities there is clear evidence that isit can lead to improved business performance and potentially for sustained competitive advantage this is obviously true through the advent of new and emerging

the rejection of nonzero initial conditions and bounded disturbances we incorporate performance robustness in the form of a guaranteed upper bound on the peak magnitude of the tracking error under plant coprime factor uncertainty estimation of an nln hammersteinwiener model estimation of a singleinput singleoutput blockoriented model is studied the model consists of a linear block embedded between two static nonlinear gains hence it is called an nln hammersteinwiener model first the model structure is motivated and the disturbance model is discussed the paper then concentrates on parameter estimation a relaxation iteration scheme is proposed by making use of a model structure in which the error is bilinearinparameters this leads to a simple algorithm which minimizes the original loss function the convergence and consistency of the algorithm are studied in order to reduce the variance error the obtained linear model is further reduced using frequency weighted model reduction a simulation study is used to illustrate the method stability and lsub 2 gain properties of lpv systems stability and lsub 2 gain properties of linear parametervarying systems are obtained under assumed bounds on either the maximum or average value of the parameter rate control of a thrustvectored flying wing a receding horizon  lpv approach this paper deals with the application of receding horizon methods to hover and forward flight models of an experimental tethered flying wing developed at caltech the dynamics of the system are representative of a vertical landing and take off aircraft such as a harrier around hover or a thrustvectored aircraft such as f18harv or x31 in forward flight the adopted control methodology is a hybrid of receding horizon techniques and control lyapunov function clfbased ideas first a clf is generated using quasilpv methods and then by using the clf as the terminal cost in the receding horizon optimization stability is guaranteed the main advantage of this approach is that stability can be guaranteed without imposing constraints in the online optimization allowing the problem to be solved in a more efficient manner models of the experimental setup are obtained for the hover and forward flight modes numerical simulations for different time horizons are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the discussed methods specifically it is shown that a mere upper bound on the costtogo is not an appropriate choice for a terminal cost when the horizon length is short simulation results are presented using experimentally verified model parameters robust control of nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainty probabilistic robustness analysis and synthesis for nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters are presented monte carlo simulation is used to estimate the likelihood of system instability and violation of performance requirements subject to variations of the probabilistic system parameters stochastic robust control synthesis searches the controller design parameter space to minimize a cost that is a function of the probabilities that design criteria will not be satisfied the robust control design approach is illustrated by a simple nonlinear example a modified feedback linearization control is chosen as controller structure and the design parameters are searched by a genetic algorithm to achieve the tradeoff between stability and performance robustness strong and weak points of the muscadet theorem proverexamples from cascjc muscadet is a knowledgebased theorem prover based on natural deduction it has participated in cade automated theorem proving system competitions the results show its complementarity with regard to resolutionbased provers this paper presents some of its crucial methods and gives some examples of muscadet proofs from the last competition cascjc in ijcar 2001 tptp casc and the development of a semantically guided theorem prover the firstorder theorem prover scott has been through a series of versions over some ten years the successive provers while retaining the same underlying technology have used radically different algorithms and shown wide differences of behaviour the development process has depended heavily on experiments with problems from the tptp library and has been sharpened by participation in casc each year since 1997 we outline some of the difficulties inherent in designing and refining a theorem prover as complex as scott and explain our experimental methodology while scott is not one of the systems which have been highly optimised for casc it does help to illustrate the influence of both casc and the tptp library on contemporary theorem proving research a phytography of waldmeister the architecture of the waldmeister prover for unit equational deduction is based on a strict separation of active and passive facts after an inspection of the systems proof procedure the representation of each of the central data structures is outlined namely indexing for the active facts compression for the passive facts successor sets for the hypotheses and minimal recording of inference steps for the proof object in order to cope with large search spaces specialized redundancy criteria are employed and the empirically gained control knowledge is integrated to ease the use of the system the paper concludes with a quantitative comparison of the waldmeister versions over the years and a view of the future prospects e  a brainiac theorem prover we describe the superpositionbased theorem prover e e is a sound and complete prover for clausal first order logic with equality important properties of the prover include strong redundancy elimination criteria the discount loop proof procedure a very flexible interface for specifying search control heuristics and an efficient inference engine we also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the system the design and implementation of vampire we describe vampire a highperformance theorem prover for firstorder logic as our description is mostly targeted to the developers of such systems and specialists in automated reasoning it focuses on the design of the system and some key implementation features we also analyze the performance of the prover at cascjc the development of casc automated theorem proving researchers who make theoretical advances also need some way to demonstrate that an advance really does have general overall positive consequences for system performance for this it is necessary to evaluate the system on a set of problems that is sufficiently large and diverse to be somehow representative of the intended application area as a whole it is only a small step from system evaluation to a communal system competition the cade atp system competition casc has been run annually since 1996 any competition is difficult to design and organize in the first instance and to then run over the years in order to obtain the full benefits of a competition a thoroughly organized event with an unambiguous and motivated design is necessary for some issues relevant to the casc design inevitable constraints have emerged for other issues there have been several choices and decisions have had to be made this paper describes the evolution of casc paying particular attention to its design design changes and organization strong completeness of latticevalued logic this paper shows strong completeness of the system l for lattice valued logic given by s titani 1999 in which she formulates a latticevalued set theory by introducing the logical implication which represents the order relation on the lattice syntax and semantics concerned are described and strong completeness is proved max and min limiters if a contained in omega  nor2 and the function maxxsub 1xsub n intersection a is partial recursive it is easily seen that a is recursive in this paper we weaken this hypothesis in various ways and similarly for min in place of max and investigate what effect this has on the complexity of a we discover a sharp contrast between retraceable and coretraceable sets and we characterize sets which are the union of a recursive set and a core retraceable set most of our proofs are noneffective several open questions are raised on the distribution of lachlan nonsplitting bases we say that a computably enumerable ce degree b is a lachlan nonsplitting base lnb if there is a computably enumerable degree a such that ab and for any ce degrees w vora if aorwvvv b then either aorwv b or aorvv b in this paper we investigate the relationship between bounding and nonbounding of lachlan nonsplitting bases and the highlow hierarchy we prove that there is a nonlowsub 2 ce degree which bounds no lachlan nonsplitting base sampleddata implementation of a gain scheduled controller a continuoustime gainscheduled controller must be transformed to a corresponding discretetime controller for sampleddata implementation we show that certain linearization properties of a continuoustime gain scheduled controller are inherited by its sampleddata implementation we also show that a similar relationship exists for multirate gain scheduled controllers arising in flight control applications simulation and transient testing of numerical relays a hybrid and practical solution for relay evaluation is presented two main issues are taken into account power system simulation and relay simulation both of which consist of different stages system simulation is carried out by means of emtp and is complemented by additional features such as filtering for location and determination of fault parameters that allow comparing simulated and actual fault records to improve and guarantee a correct system simulation relay simulation includes filtering algorithms all the relaying units and the decision logic playing simulated or real faults over the actual relay and comparing simulated and real responses can check for correct relay simulation stabilization of positive systems with first integrals positive systems possessing first integrals are considered these systems frequently occur in applications the paper is devoted to two stabilization problems the first is concerned with the design of feedbacks to stabilize a given level set secondly it is shown that the same feedback allows us to globally stabilize an equilibrium point if it is asymptotically stable with respect to initial conditions in its level set two examples are provided and the results are compared with those in the literature bandwidth vs gains design of hsub infinity  tracking controllers for currentfed induction motors describes a systematic procedure for designing speed and rotor flux norm tracking hsub infinity  controllers with unknown load torque disturbances for currentfed induction motors a new effective design tool is developed to allow selection of the control gains so as to adjust the disturbances rejection capability of the controllers in the face of the bandwidth requirements of the closedloop system application of the proposed design procedure is demonstrated in a case study and the results of numerical simulations illustrate the satisfactory performance achievable even in presence of rotor resistance uncertainty analysis of exclusively kinetic twolink underactuated mechanical systems analysis of exclusively kinetic twolink underactuated mechanical systems is undertaken it is first shown that such systems are not fullstate feedback linearizable around any equilibrium point also the equilibrium points for which the system is smalltime locally controllable stlc is at most a onedimensional submanifold a concept less restrictive than stlc termed the smalltime local output controllability stloc is introduced the satisfaction of which guarantees that a chosen configuration output can be controlled at its desired value it is shown that the class of systems considered is stloc if the inertial coupling between the input and output is nonzero also in such a case the system is nonminimum phase an example section illustrates all the results presented observerbased strict positive real spr feedback control system design presents theory for stability analysis and design for a class of observerbased feedback control systems relaxation of the controllability and observability conditions imposed in the yakubovichkalmanpopov lemma can be made for a class of nonlinear systems described by a linear timeinvariant system with a feedbackconnected conebounded nonlinear element it is shown how a circlecriterion approach can be used to design an observerbased state feedback control which yields a closedloop system with specified robustness characteristics the approach is relevant for design with preservation of stability when a conebounded nonlinearity is introduced in the feedback loop important applications are to be found in nonlinear control with high robustness requirements analysis of nonlinear timedelay systems using modules over noncommutative rings the theory of noncommutative rings is introduced to provide a basis for the study of nonlinear control systems with time delays the left ore ring of noncommutative polynomials defined over the field of a meromorphic function is suggested as the framework for such a study this approach is then generalized to a broader class of nonlinear systems with delays that are called generalized roesser systems finally the theory is applied to analyze nonlinear timedelay systems a weak observability is defined and characterized generalizing the wellknown linear result properties of closed submodules are then developed to obtain a result on the accessibility of such systems nonasymptotic confidence ellipsoids for the leastsquares estimate we consider the finite sample properties of leastsquares system identification and derive nonasymptotic confidence ellipsoids for the estimate the shape of the confidence ellipsoids is similar to the shape of the ellipsoids derived using asymptotic theory but unlike asymptotic theory they are valid for a finite number of data points the probability that the estimate belongs to a certain ellipsoid has a natural dependence on the volume of the ellipsoid the data generating mechanism the model order and the number of data points available doubly invariant equilibria of linear discretetime games the notion of doubly invariant di equilibrium is introduced the concept extends controlled and robustly controlled invariance notions to the context of twoperson dynamic games each player tries to keep the state in a region of state space independently of the actions of the rival player the paper gives existence conditions criteria and algorithms for the determination of di equilibria of linear dynamic games in discrete time two examples illustrate the results the first one is in the area of faulttolerant controller synthesis the second is an application to macroeconomics lsub 2 model reduction and variance reduction we examine certain variance properties of model reduction the focus is on lsub 2 model reduction but some general results are also presented these general results can be used to analyze various other model reduction schemes the models we study are finite impulse response fir and output error oe models we compare the variance of two estimated models the first one is estimated directly from data and the other one is computed by reducing a high order model by lsub 2 model reduction in the fir case we show that it is never better to estimate the model directly from data compared to estimating it via lsub 2 model reduction of a high order fir model for oe models we show that the reduced model has the same variance as the directly estimated one if the reduced model class used contains the true system sliding mode dynamics in continuous feedback control for distributed discreteevent scheduling a continuous feedback control approach for realtime scheduling of discrete events is presented motivated by the need for control theoretic techniques to analyze and design such systems in distributed manufacturing applications these continuous feedback control systems exhibit highly nonlinear and discontinuous dynamics specifically when the production demand in the manufacturing system exceeds the available resource capacity then the control system chatters and exhibits sliding modes this sliding mode behavior is advantageously used in the scheduling application by allowing the system to visit different schedules within an infinitesimal region near the sliding surface in the paper an analytical model is developed to characterize the sliding mode dynamics this model is then used to design controllers in the sliding mode domain to improve the effectiveness of the control system to search for schedules with good performance computational results indicate that the continuous feedback control approach can provide nearoptimal schedules and that it is computationally efficient compared to existing scheduling techniques identification of linear parameter varying models we consider identification of a certain class of discretetime nonlinear systems known as linear parameter varying system we assume that inputs outputs and the scheduling parameters are directly measured and a form of the functional dependence of the system coefficients on the parameters is known we show how this identification problem can be reduced to a linear regression and provide compact formulae for the corresponding least mean square and recursive leastsquares algorithms we derive conditions on persistency of excitation in terms of the inputs and scheduling parameter trajectories when the functional dependence is of polynomial type these conditions have a natural polynomial interpolation interpretation and do not require the scheduling parameter trajectories to vary slowly this method is illustrated with a simulation example using two different parameter trajectories robustness of trajectories with finite time extent the problem of estimating perturbation bounds of finite trajectories is considered the trajectory is assumed to be generated by a linear system with uncertainty characterized in terms of integral quadratic constraints it is shown that such perturbation bounds can be obtained as the solution to a nonconvex quadratic optimization problem which can be addressed using lagrange relaxation the result can be used in robustness analysis of hybrid systems and switched dynamical systems on trajectory and force tracking control of constrained mobile manipulators with parameter uncertainty studies the trajectory and force tracking control problem of mobile manipulators subject to holonomic and nonholonomic constraints with unknown inertia parameters adaptive controllers are proposed based on a suitable reduced dynamic model the defined reference signals and the mixed tracking errors the proposed controllers not only ensure the entire state of the system to asymptotically converge to the desired trajectory but also ensure the constraint force to asymptotically converge to the desired force a detailed numerical example is presented to illustrate the developed methods closedloop persistent identification of linear systems with unmodeled dynamics and stochastic disturbances the essential issues of time complexity and probing signal selection are studied for persistent identification of linear timeinvariant systems in a closedloop setting by establishing both upper and lower bounds on identification accuracy as functions of the length of observation size of unmodeled dynamics and stochastic disturbances we demonstrate the inherent impact of unmodeled dynamics on identification accuracy reduction of time complexity by stochastic averaging on disturbances and probing capability of full rank periodic signals for closedloop persistent identification these findings indicate that the mixed formulation in which deterministic uncertainty of system dynamics is blended with random disturbances is beneficial to reduction of identification complexity closedloop model set validation under a stochastic framework deals with probabilistic model set validation it is assumed that the dynamics of a multiinput multioutput mimo plant is described by a model set with unstructured uncertainties and identification experiments are performed in closed loop a necessary and sufficient condition has been derived for the consistency of the model set with both the stabilizing controller and closedloop frequency domain experimental data fded in this condition only the euclidean norm of a complex vector is involved and this complex vector depends linearly on both the disturbances and the measurement errors based on this condition an analytic formula has been derived for the sample unfalsified probability sup of the model set some of the asymptotic statistical properties of the sup have also been briefly discussed a numerical example is included to illustrate the efficiency of the suggested method in model set quality evaluation switching controller design via convex polyhedral lyapunov functions we propose a systematic switching control design method for a class of nonlinear discrete time hybrid systems the novelty of the adopted approach is in the fact that unlike conventional control the control burden is shifted to a logical level thus creating the need for the development of new analysisdesign methods an algorithm combining neural networks with fundamental parameters an algorithm combining neural networks with the fundamental parameters equations nnfp is proposed for making corrections for nonlinear matrix effects in xray fluorescence analysis in the algorithm neural networks were applied to relate the concentrations of components to both the measured intensities and the relative theoretical intensities calculated by the fundamental parameter equations the nnfp algorithm is compared with the classical theoretical correction models including the fundamental parameters approach the lachancetraill model a hyperbolic function model and the cola algorithm for an alloy system with 15 measured elements in most cases the prediction errors of the nnfp algorithm are lower than those of the fundamental parameters approach the lachancetraill model the hyperbolic function model and the cola algorithm separately if there are the serious matrix effects such as matrix effects among cr fe and ni the nnfp algorithm generally decreased predictive errors as compared with the classical models except for the case of cr by the fundamental parameters approach the main reason why the nnfp algorithm has generally a better predictive ability than the classical theoretical correction models might be that neural networks can better calibrate the nonlinear matrix

a railway freight wagon by springs with linear characteristics and dry friction dampers the wagon runs on an ideal straight and level track with constant speed the lateral dynamics in dependence on the speed is examined we have included stickslip and hysteresis in our model of the dry friction and assume that coulombs law holds during the slip phase it is found that the action of dry friction completely changes the bifurcation diagram and that the longitudinal component of the dry friction damping forces destabilizes the wagon userappropriate tyremodelling for vehicle dynamics in standard and limit situations when modelling vehicles for the vehicle dynamic simulation special attention must be paid to the modelling of tyre forces and torques according to their dominant influence on the results this task is not only about sufficiently exact representation of the effective forces but also about userfriendly and practical relevant applicability especially when the experimental tyreinputdata is incomplete or missing this text firstly describes the basics of the vehicle dynamic tyre model conceived to be a physically based semiempirical model for application in connection with multibodysystems mbs on the basis of tyres for a passenger car and a heavy truck the simulated steady state tyre characteristics are shown together and compared with the underlying experimental values the possibility to link the tyre model tmeasy to any mbsprogram is described as far as it supports the standard tyre interface as an example the simulated and experimental data of a heavy truck doing a standardized driving manoeuvre are compared design of a stroke dependent damper for the front axle suspension of a truck using multibody system dynamics and numerical optimization a stroke dependent damper is designed for the front axle suspension of a truck the damper supplies extra damping for inward deflections rising above 4 cm in this way the damper should reduce extreme suspension deflections without deteriorating the comfort of the truck but the question is which stroke dependent damping curve yields the best compromise between suspension deflection working space and comfort therefore an optimization problem is defined to minimize the maximum inward suspension deflection subject to constraints on the chassis acceleration for three typical road undulations the optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming slp and multibody dynamics simulation software several optimization runs have been carried out for a small two degree of freedom vehicle model and a large fullscale model of the truck semitrailer combination the results show that the stroke dependent damping can reduce large deflections at incidental road disturbances but that the optimum stroke dependent damping curve is related to the acceleration bound by means of vehicle model simulation and numerical optimization we have been able to quantify this tradeoff between suspension deflection working space and truck comfort human face detection in visual scenes using neural networks this paper presents a neural network based face detection system our objective is to design a system that can detect human faces in visual scenes at high searching speed and accuracy we used a neural network with a simple structure but trained using face and nonface samples preprocessed by several methods position normalization histogram equalization etc to attain high accuracy then pruned the size of the neural network so that it could run faster and reduced the total search area of a target visual scene using the skin color detector skin color detection assumes that faces reside only in skin color regions the system design is made up of two parts the face detecting system that detects the faces and the searching speed improving system speed improvement is achieved by reducing the face locator network size using the structural learning with knowledge and by reducing the face search area using the skin color detection system faster training of the neural networks was also achieved using variable step sizes decentralized adaptive output feedback stabilization for a class of interconnected systems with unknown bound of uncertainties the problem of adaptive decentralized stabilization for a class of linear timeinvarying largescale systems with nonlinear interconnectivity and

trajectory tracking controllers for autonomous vehicles the design technique builds on gain scheduling control theory an application is made to the design of a trajectory tracking controller for a prototype autonomous underwater vehicle auv the effectiveness and advantages of the new control laws derived are illustrated in simulation using a full set of nonlinear equations of motion of the vehicle robust lsub 2 disturbance attenuation for nonlinear systems with input dynamical uncertainty deals with the problem of robust lsub 2 disturbance attenuation for nonlinear systems with input dynamical uncertainty the input dynamical uncertainty is restricted to be minimumphase and relative degree zero a sufficient condition is given such that the nonlinear system satisfies the lsub 2 gain performance and inputtostate stable property using this condition a design approach is given for a smooth state feedback control law that solves the robust lsub 2 disturbance attenuation problem and the approach is extended to a more general case where the nominal system has higher relative degree finally a numerical example is given to demonstrate the proposed approach fc functional tools for objectoriented tasks fc is a library for programming functionally in c compared to other c functional programming libraries fc is distinguished by its powerful type system which allows the manipulation of parametrically polymorphic functions eg passing them as arguments to other functions and returning them as results in this paper we show how fc can be used in common objectoriented programming tasks we demonstrate fc implementations of several common design patterns adapter builder command and more compared to conventional c implementations of these patterns our implementations are either simpler in that fewer classesdependencies are needed more efficient or more typesafe thanks to parametric polymorphism and type inference engineering plugin software components to support collaborative work many software applications require cooperative work support including collaborative editing group awareness versioning messaging and automated notification and coordination agents most approaches hardcode such facilities into applications with fixed functionality and limited ability to reuse groupware implementations we describe our recent work in seamlessly adding such capabilities to componentbased applications via a set of collaborative worksupporting plugin software components we describe a variety of applications of this technique along with descriptions of the novel architecture user interface adaptation and implementation techniques for the collaborative worksupporting components that we have developed we report on our experiences to date with this method of supporting collaborative work enhancement of componentbased systems and discuss the advantages of our approach over conventional techniques the bliss programming language a history the bliss programming language was invented by william a wulf and others at carnegiemellon university in 1969 originally for the dec pdp10 bliss10 caught the interest of ronald f brender of dec digital equipment corporation after several years of collaboration including the creation of bliss11 for the pdp11 bliss was adopted as decs implementation language for use on its new line of vax computers in 1975 dec developed a completely new generation of blisss for the vax pdp10 and pdp11 which became widely used at dec during the 1970s and 1980s with the creation of the alpha architecture in the early 1990s bliss was extended again in both 32 and 64bit flavors bliss support for the intel ia32 architecture was introduced in 1995 and ia64 support is now in progress bliss has a number of unusual characteristics it is typeless requires use of an explicit contents of operator written as a period or dot takes an algorithmic approach to data structure definition has no goto is an expression language and has an unusually rich compiletime language this paper reviews the evolution and use of bliss over its three decade lifetime emphasis is on how the language evolved to facilitate portable

which makes com classes available to plt scheme programs when needed mysterx uses a programmable web browser to display com objects we describe the technical issues encountered in building these two systems and sketch some applications tool and process improvements from mfc control system technology a new approach to mfc calibration links the physical parameters of nitrogen to the physical characteristics of various process gases this precludes the conventional need for surrogate gases what results is a physicsbased tuning algorithm and enhanced digital control system that enables rearranging and gas change of digital mfcs the end result should be better process control through more accurate gas flow the new method also decreases the number of mfc spare parts required to back up a fab integrated process control using an in situ sensor for etch the migration to tighter geometries and more complex process sequence integration schemes requires having the ability to compensate for upstream deviations from target specifications doing so ensures thatdownstream process sequences operate on workinprogress that is well within control because pointofuse visibility of workinprogress quality has become of paramount concern in the industrys drive to reduce scrap and improve yield controlling trench depth has assumed greater importance an integrated interferometric based rate monitor for etchtodepth and spacer etch applications has been developed for controlling this parameter this article demonstrates that the integrated rate monitor using polarization and digital signal processing enhances control etchtodepth processes and can also be implemented as a predictive endpoint in a wafer manufacturing environment for dual damascene trench etch and spacer

not detectable with conventional mr imaging linear parametervarying control and its application to a turbofan engine this paper describes application of parameterdependent control design methods to a turbofan engine parameterdependent systems are linear systems whose statespace descriptions are known functions of timevarying parameters the time variation of each of the parameters is not known in advance but is assumed to be measurable in realtime three linear parametervarying lpv approaches to control design are discussed the first method is based on linear fractional transformations which relies on the small gain theorem for bounds on performance and robustness the other methods make use of either a single sqlf or parameterdependent pdqlf quadratic lyapunov function to bound the achievable level of performance the latter two techniques are used to synthesize controllers for a highperformance turbofan engine a lpv model of the turbofan engine is constructed from jacobian linearizations at fixed power codes for control design the control problem is formulated as a model matching problem in the hsub infinity  and lpv framework the objective is decoupled command response of the closedloop system to pressure and rotor speed requests the performance of linear hsub infinity  point designs are compared with the sqlf and pdqlf controllers nonlinear simulations indicate that the controller synthesized using the sqlf approach is slightly more conservative than the pdqlf controller nonlinear simulations with the sqlf and pdqlf controllers show very robust designs that achieve all desired performance objectives breast cancer effectiveness of computeraided diagnosisobserver study with independent database of mammograms evaluates the effectiveness of a computerized

those without computer aid  delta 0014 p46 95 cl 0054 0026 where delta is difference in specificity when we analyzed results from the mammographers and community radiologists as separate groups a larger improvement was demonstrated for the community radiologists computeraided diagnosis can potentially help radiologists improve their diagnostic accuracy in the task of differentiating between benign and malignant masses seen on mammograms pulmonary perfusion patterns and pulmonary arterial pressure uses artificial intelligence methods to determine whether quantitative parameters describing the perfusion image can be synthesized to make a reasonable estimate of the pulmonary arterial pa pressure measured at angiography radionuclide perfusion images were obtained in 120 patients with normal chest radiographs who also underwent angiographic pa pressure measurement within 3 days of the radionuclide study an artificial neural network ann was constructed from several image parameters describing statistical and boundary characteristics of the perfusion images with use of a leaveoneout crossvalidation technique this method was used to predict the pa systolic pressure in cases on which the ann had not been trained a pearson correlation coefficient was determined between the predicted and measured pa systolic pressures ann predictions correlated with measured pulmonary systolic pressures r0846 p001 the accuracy of the predictions was not influenced by the presence of pulmonary embolism none of the 51 patients with predicted pa pressures of less than 29 mm hg had pulmonary hypertension at angiography all 13 patients with predicted pa pressures greater than 48 mm hg had pulmonary hypertension at angiography meaningful information regarding pa pressure can be derived from noninvasive radionuclide perfusion scanning the use of image analysis in concert with artificial intelligence methods helps to reveal physiologic information not readily apparent at visual image inspection a novel preterm respiratory mechanics active simulator to test the performances of neonatal pulmonary ventilators a patient active simulator is proposed which is capable of reproducing values of the parameters of pulmonary mechanics of healthy newborns and preterm pathological infants the implemented prototype is able to a let the operator choose the respiratory pattern times of apnea episodes of cough sobs etc b continuously regulate and control the parameters characterizing the pulmonary system and finally c reproduce the attempt of breathing of a preterm infant taking into account both the limitation due to the chosen application field and the preliminary autocalibration phase automatically carried out by the proposed device accuracy and reliability on the order of 1 is estimated the previously indicated value has to be considered satisfactory in light of the field of application and the small values of the simulated parameters finally the achieved metrological characteristics allow the described neonatal simulator to be adopted as a reference device to test performances of neonatal ventilators and more specifically to measure the time elapsed between the occurrence of a potentially dangerous condition to the patient and the activation of the corresponding alarm of the tested ventilator a sixdegreeoffreedom precision motion stage this article presents

simulation results which demonstrate its performance and cost benefits in highspeed backbone networking scenarios negotiating the semantics of agent communication languages this article presents a formal framework and outlines a method that autonomous agents can use to negotiate the semantics of their communication language at runtime such an ability is needed in open multiagent systems so that agents can ensure they understand the implications of the utterances that are being made and so that they can tailor the meaning of the primitives to best fit their prevailing circumstances to this end the semantic space framework provides a systematic means of classifying the primitives along multiple relevant dimensions this classification can then be used by the agents to structure their negotiation or semantic fixing process so that they converge to the mutually agreeable semantics that are necessary for coherent social interactions toward a formalism for conversation protocols using joint intention theory conversation protocols are used to achieve certain goals or to bring about certain states in the world therefore one may identify the landmarks or the states that must be brought about during the goaldirected execution of a protocol accordingly the landmarks characterized by propositions that are true in the state represented by that landmark are the most important aspect of a protocol families of conversation protocols can be expressed formally as partially ordered landmarks after the landmarks necessary to achieve a goal have been identified concrete protocols represented as joint action expressions can then be derived from the partially ordered landmarks and executed directly by joint intention interpreters this approach of applying joint intention theory to protocols also supports flexibility in the actions used to get to landmarks shortcutting protocol execution automatic exception handling and correctness criterion for protocols and protocol compositions new jersey african american women writers and their publications a study of identification from written and oral sources this study examines the use of written sources and personal interviews and informal conversations with individuals from new jerseys religious political and educational community to identify african american women writers in new jersey and their intellectual output the focus on recognizing the community as an oral repository of history and then tapping these oral sources for collection development and acquisition purposes is supported by empirical and qualitative evidence findings indicate that written sources are so limited that information professionals must rely on oral sources to uncover local writers and their publications to commit or not to commit modeling agent conversations for action conversations are sequences of messages exchanged among interacting agents for conversations to be meaningful agents ought to follow commonly known specifications limiting the types of messages that can be exchanged at any point in the conversation these specifications are usually implemented using conversation policies which are rules of inference or conversation protocols which are predefined conversation templates in this article we present a semantic model for specifying conversations using conversation policies this model is based on the principles that the negotiation and uptake of shared social commitments entail the adoption of obligations to action which indicate the actions that agents have agreed to perform in the same way obligations are retracted based on the negotiation to discharge their corresponding shared social commitments based on these principles conversations are specified as interaction specifications that model the ideal sequencing of agent participations negotiating the execution of actions in a joint activity these specifications not only specify the adoption and discharge of shared commitments and obligations during an activity but also indicate the commitments and obligations that are required as preconditions or that outlive a joint activity as postconditions we model the contract net protocol as an example of the specification of conversations in a joint activity an acl for a dynamic system of agents in this article we present the design of an acl for a dynamic system of agents the acl includes a set of conversation performatives extended with operations to register create and terminate agents the main design goal at the agentlevel is to provide only knowledgelevel primitives that are well integrated with the dynamic nature of the system this goal has been achieved by defining an anonymous interaction protocol which enables agents to request and supply knowledge without considering symbollevel issues concerning management of agent names routing and agent reachability this anonymous interaction protocol exploits a distributed facilitator schema which is hidden at the agentlevel and provides mechanisms for registering capabilities of agents and delivering requests according to the competence of agents we present a formal specification of the acl and of the underlying architecture exploiting an algebra of actors and illustrate it with the help of a graphical notation this approach provides the basis for discussing dynamic primitives in acl and for studying properties of dynamic multi agent systems for example concerning the behavior of agents and the correctness of their conversation policies trends in agent communication language agent technology is an exciting and important new way to create complex software systems agents blend many of the traditional properties of ai programs  knowledgelevel reasoning flexibility proactiveness goaldirectedness and so forth  with insights gained from distributed software engineering machine learning negotiation and teamwork theory and the social sciences an important part of the agent approach is the principle that agents like humans can function more effectively in groups that are characterized by cooperation and division of labor agent programs are designed to autonomously collaborate with each other in order to satisfy both their internal goals and the shared external demands generated by virtue of their participation in agent societies this type of collaboration depends on a sophisticated system of interagent communication the assumption that interagent communication is best handled through the explicit use of an agent communication language acl underlies each of the articles in this special issue in this introductory article we will supply a brief background and introduction to the main topics in agent communication predictive control of a high

fading channels orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm has been applied in broadband wireline and wireless systems for high data rate transmission where severe intersymbol interference isi always occurs the conventional ofdm system provides advantages through conversion of an isi channel into isifree subchannels at multiple frequency bands however it may suffer from channel spectral nulls and heavy data rate overhead due to cyclic prefix insertion previously a new ofdm framework the precoded ofdm has been proposed to mitigate the above two problems through precoding and conversion of an isi channel into isifree vector channels in this paper we consider the application of the precoded ofdm system to efficient scalable video transmission we propose to enhance the precoded ofdm system with adaptive vector channel allocation to provide stronger protection against errors to more important layers in the layered bit stream structure of scalable video the more critical layers or equivalently the lower layers are allocated vector channels of higher transmission quality the channel quality is characterized by frobenius norm metrics based on channel estimation at the receiver the channel allocation information is fed back periodically to the transmitter through a control channel simulation results have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed scheme to noise and fading inherent in wireless channels iwap an intelligent wap site management system the popularity regarding wireless communications is such that more and more wap sites have been developed with wireless markup language wml meanwhile to translate hypertext markup language html pages into proper wml ones becomes imperative since it is difficult for wap users to read most contents designed for pc users via their mobile phone screens however for those sites that have been maintained with hypertext markup language html considerable time and manpower costs will be incurred to rebuild them with wml in this paper we propose an intelligent wap site management system to cope with these problems with the help of the intelligent management system the original contents of html web sites can be automatically translated to proper wap content in an efficient way as a consequence the costs associated with maintaining wap sites could be significantly reduced the management system also allows the system manager to define the relevance of numerals and keywords for removing unimportant or meaningless contents the original contents will be reduced and reorganized to fit the size of mobile phone screens thus reducing the communication cost and enhancing readability numerical results gained through various experiments have evinced the effective performance of the wap management system a framework of electronic tendering for government procurement a lesson learned in taiwan to render government procurement efficient transparent nondiscriminating and accountable an electronic

which can be integrated easily within most existing information infrastructures the development of a mobile manipulator imaging system for bridge crack inspection a mobile manipulator imaging system is developed for the automation of bridge crack inspection during bridge safety inspections an eyesight inspection is made for preliminary evaluation and screening before a more precise inspection the inspection for cracks is an important part of the preliminary evaluation currently the inspectors must stand on the platform of a bridge inspection vehicle or a temporarily erected scaffolding to examine the underside of a bridge however such a procedure is risky to help automate the bridge crack inspection process we installed two ccd cameras and a fouraxis manipulator system on a mobile vehicle the parallel cameras are used to detect cracks the manipulator system is equipped with binocular charge coupled devices ccd for examining structures that may not be accessible to the eye the system also reduces the danger of accidents to the human inspectors the manipulator system consists of four arms balance weights are placed at the ends of arms 2 and 4 respectively to maintain the center of gravity during operation mechanically arms 2 and 4 can revolve smoothly experiments indicated that the system could be useful for bridge crack inspections integrating building management system and facilities management on the internet recently it is of great interest to adopt the internetintranet to develop building management systems bms and facilities management systems fms this paper addresses two technical issues the webbased access including database integration and the integration of bms and fms these should be addressed for accessing bms remotely via the internet integrating control networks using the internet protocols and infrastructures and using internetintranet for building facilities management an experimental internetenabled system that integrates building and facilities management systems has been developed and tested this system integrated open control networks with the internet and is developed utilizing the embedded web server the pc web server and the distributed component object model dcom software development technology on the platform of an open control network three strategies for interconnecting bms local networks via internetintranet are presented and analyzed modelling user acceptance of building management systems this study examines user acceptance of building management systems bms using a questionnaire survey these systems are crucial for optimising building performance and yet it has been widely reported that users are not making full use of their systems facilities established models of technology acceptance have been employed in this research and the positive influence of user perceptions of ease of use and compatibility has been demonstrated previous research has indicated differing levels of importance of perceived ease of use relative to other factors here perceived ease of use is shown generally to be more important though the balance between this and compatibility is moderated by the user perceptions of voluntariness estimating populations for collective dose calculations the collective dose provides an estimate of the effects of facility operations on the public based on an estimate of the population in the area geographic information system software electronic population data resources and a personal computer were used to develop estimates of population within 80 km radii of two sites a new graphical user interface for fast construction of computation phantoms and mcnp calculations application to calibration of in vivo measurement systems reports on a new utility for development of computational phantoms for monte carlo calculations and data analysis for in vivo measurements of radionuclides deposited in tissues the individual properties of each worker can be acquired for a rather precise geometric representation of his her anatomy which is particularly important for low energy gamma ray emitting sources such as thorium uranium plutonium and other actinides the software enables automatic creation of an mcnp input data file based on scanning data the utility includes segmentation of images obtained with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging by distinguishing tissues according to their signal brightness and specification of the source and detector in addition a coupling of individual voxels within the tissue is used to reduce the memory demand and to increase the calculational speed the utility was tested for low energy emitters in plastic and biological tissues as well as for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scanning information the acquisition of outofprint music nonspecialist librarians are alerted to factors important in the successful acquisition of outofprint music both scholarly editions and performance editions the appropriate technical music vocabulary the music publishing industry specialized publishers and vendors and methods of acquisition of outofprint printed music are introduced and the need for familiarity with them is emphasized general solution of a density functionally gradient piezoelectric cantilever and its applications we have used the plane strain theory of transversely isotropic bodies to study a piezoelectric cantilever in order to find the general solution of a density functionally gradient piezoelectric cantilever we have used the inverse method ie the airy stress function method we have obtained the stress and induction functions in the form of polynomials as well as the general solution of the beam based on this general solution we have deduced the solutions of the cantilever under different loading conditions furthermore as applications of this general solution in engineering we have studied the tip deflection and blocking force of a piezoelectric cantilever actuator finally we have addressed a method to determine the density distribution profile for a given piezoelectric material recording quantum properties of light in a longlived atomic spin state towards quantum memory we report an experiment on mapping a quantum state of light onto the ground state spin of an ensemble of cs atoms with the lifetime of 2 ms recording of one of the two quadrature phase operators of light is demonstrated with vacuum and squeezed states of light the sensitivity of the mapping procedure at the level of approximately 1 photonsec per hz is shown the results pave the road towards complete storing both quadrature phase observables quantum memory for gaussian states of light the experiment also sheds new light on fundamental limits of sensitivity of the magnetooptical resonance method comprehensive encoding and decoupling solution to problems of decoherence and design in solidstate quantum computing proposals for scalable quantum computing devices suffer not only from decoherence due to the interaction with their environment but also from severe engineering constraints here we introduce a practical solution to these major concerns addressing solidstate proposals in particular decoherence is first reduced by encoding a logical qubit into two qubits then completely eliminated by an efficient set of decoupling pulse sequences the same encoding removes the need for singlequbit operations which pose a difficult design constraint we further show how the dominant decoherence processes can be identified empirically in order to optimize the decoupling pulses social percolation and the influence of mass media in the marketing model of solomon and weisbuch people buy a product only if their neighbours tell them of its quality and if this quality is higher than their own quality expectations now we introduce additional information from the mass media which is analogous to the ghost field in percolation theory the mass media shift the percolative phase transition observed in the model and decrease the time after which the stationary state is reached estimating longrange dependence finite sample properties and confidence intervals a major issue in financial economics is the behavior of asset returns over long horizons various estimators of longrange dependence have been proposed even though some have known asymptotic properties it is important to test their accuracy by using simulated series of different lengths we test rs analysis detrended fluctuation analysis and periodogram regression methods on samples drawn from gaussian white noise the dfa statistics turns out to be the unanimous winner unfortunately no asymptotic distribution theory has been derived for this statistics so far we were able however to construct empirical ie approximate confidence intervals for all three methods the obtained values differ largely from heuristic values proposed by some authors for the rs statistics and are very close to asymptotic values for the periodogram regression method simulation of evacuation processes using a bionicsinspired cellular automaton model for pedestrian dynamics we present simulations of evacuation processes using a recently introduced cellular automaton model for pedestrian dynamics this model applies a bionics approach to describe the interaction between the pedestrians using ideas from chemotaxis here we study a rather simple situation namely the evacuation from a large room with one or two doors it is shown that the variation of the model parameters allows to describe different types of behaviour from regular to panic we find a nonmonotonic dependence of the evacuation times on the coupling constants these times depend on the strength of the herding behaviour with minimal evacuation times for some intermediate values of the couplings ie a proper combination of herding and use of knowledge about the shortest way to the exit dynamical transition to periodic motions of a recurrent bus induced by nonstops we study the dynamical behavior of a recurrent bus on a circular route with many bus stops when the recurrent bus passes some bus stops without stopping the recurrent time one period is described in terms of a nonlinear map it is shown that the recurrent bus exhibits the complex periodic behaviors the dynamical transitions to periodic motions occur by increasing nonstops the periodic motions depend on the property of an attractor of the nonlinear map the period n of the attractor varies sensitively with the number of nonstops the two populations cellular automata model with predation based on the penna model in pennas 1995 singlespecies asexual bitstring model of biological ageing the verhulst factor has too strong a restraining effect on the development of the population danuta makowiec gave an improved model based on the lattice where the restraining factor of the four neighbours take the place of the verhulst factor here we discuss the two populations penna model with predation on the planar lattice of two dimensions a cellular automata model containing movable wolves and sheep has been built the results show that both the quantity of the wolves and the sheep fluctuate in accordance with the law that one quantity increases while the other one decreases option pricing from path integral for nongaussian fluctuations natural martingale and application to truncated levy distributions within a path integral formalism for nongaussian price fluctuations we set up a simple stochastic calculus and derive a natural martingale for option pricing from the wealth balance of options stocks and bonds the resulting formula is evaluated for truncated levy distributions quantum market games we propose a quantumlike description of markets and economics the approach has roots in the recently developed quantum game theory on the emergence of rules in neural networks a simple associationist neural network learns to factor abstract rules ie grammars from sequences of arbitrary input symbols by inventing abstract representations that accommodate unseen symbol sets as well as unseen but similar grammars the neural network is shown to have the ability to transfer grammatical knowledge to both new symbol vocabularies and new grammars analysis of the statespace shows that the network learns generalized abstract structures of the input and is not simply memorizing the input strings these representations are context sensitive hierarchical and based on the state variable of the finitestate machines that the neural network has learned generalization to new symbol sets or grammars arises from the spatial nature of the internal representations used by the network allowing new symbol sets to be encoded close to symbol sets that have already been learned in the hidden unit space of the network the results are counter to the arguments that learning algorithms based on weight adaptation after each exemplar presentation such as the long term potentiation found in the mammalian nervous system cannot in principle extract symbolic knowledge from positive examples as prescribed by prevailing human linguistic theory and evolutionary psychology streaming disruptive interference and powerlaw behavior in the exit dynamics of confined pedestrians we analyze the exit dynamics of pedestrians who are initially confined in a room pedestrians are modeled as cellular automata and compete to escape via a known exit at the soonest possible time a pedestrian could move forward backward left or right within each iteration time depending on adjacent cell vacancy and in accordance with simple rules that determine the compulsion to move and physical capability relative to his neighbors the arching signatures of jamming were observed and the pedestrians exited in bursts of various sizes powerlaw behavior is found in the burstsize frequency distribution for exit widths w greater than one cell dimension w  1 the slope of the powerlaw curve varies with w from 13092 w  2 to 10720 w  20 streaming which is a diffusive behavior arises in large burst sizes and is more likely in a singleexit room with w  1 and leads to a counterintuitive result wherein an average exit throughput q is obtained that is higher than with w  2 3 or 4 for a twoexit room w  1 q is not greater than twice the yield of a singleexit room if the doors are not separated far enough  4w q becomes even significantly less due to a collective slowdown that emerges among pedestrians crossing in each others path disruptive interference effect for the same w and door number q is also higher with relaxed pedestrians than with anxious ones the influence of tollbooths on highway traffic we study the effects of tollbooths on the traffic flow the highway traffic is simulated by the nagelschreckenberg model various types of toll collection are examined which can be characterized either by a waiting time or a reduced speed a firstorder phase transition is observed the phase separation results a saturated flow which is observed as a plateau region in the fundamental diagram the effects of lane expansion near the tollbooth are examined the full capacity of a highway can be restored the emergence of vehicle queuing is studied besides the numerical results we also obtain analytical expressions for various quantities the numerical simulations can be well described by the analytical formulas we also discuss the influence on the travel time and its variance the tollbooth increases the travel time but decreases its variance the differences between long and shortdistance travelers are also discussed the bagsik oscillator without complex numbers we argue that the analysis of the socalled bagsik oscillator recently published by piotrowski and sladkowski 2001 is erroneous due to 1 the incorrect banking data used and 2 the application of statistical mechanism apparatus to processes that are totally deterministic the variance of firm growth rates the scaling puzzle recent evidence suggests that a powerlaw relationship exists between a firms size and the variance of its growth rate the flatness of the relation is regarded as puzzling in that it suggests that large firms are not much more stable than small firms it has been suggested that the powerlaw nature of the relationship reflects the presence of some form of correlation of growth rates across the firms constituent businesses here it is shown that a model of independent businesses which allows for the fact that these businesses vary in size as modelled by a simple partitions of integers model provides a good representation of what is observed empirically antipersistent markov behavior in foreign exchange markets a quantitative check of efficiency in us dollardeutsche mark exchange rates is developed using highfrequency tick by tick data the antipersistent markov behavior of logprice fluctuations of given size implies in principle the possibility of a statistical forecast we introduce and measure the available information of the quote sequence and we show how it can be profitable following a particular trading rule stock market dynamics we elucidate on several empirical statistical observations of stock market returns moreover we find that these properties are recurrent and are also present in invariant measures of lowdimensional dynamical systems thus we propose that the returns are modeled by the first poincare return time of a lowdimensional chaotic trajectory this modeling which captures the recurrent properties of the return fluctuations is able to predict well the evolution of the observed statistical quantities in addition it explains the reason for which stocks present simultaneously dynamical properties and high uncertainties in our analysis we use data from the sp 500 index and the brazilian stock telebras application of nonlinear time series analysis techniques to highfrequency currency exchange data in this work we have applied nonlinear time series analysis to highfrequency currency exchange data the time series studied are the exchange rates between the us dollar and 18 other foreign currencies from within and without the euro zone our goal was to determine if their dynamical behaviours were in some way correlated the nonexistence of stationarity called for the application of recurrence quantification analysis as a tool for this analysis and is based on the definition of several parameters that allow for the quantification of recurrence plots the method was checked using the european monetary system currency exchanges the results show as expected the high correlation between the currencies that are part of the euro but also a strong correlation between the japanese yen the canadian dollar and the british pound singularities of the series are also demonstrated taking into account historical events in 1996 in the euro zone modeling daily realized futures volatility with singular spectrum analysis using singular spectrum analysis ssa we model the realized volatility and logarithmic standard deviations of two important futures return series the realized volatility and logarithmic standard deviations are constructed following the methodology of andersen et al j am stat ass 96 2001 4255 using intraday transaction data we find that ssa decomposes the volatility series quite well and effectively captures both the market trend accounting for about 3438 of the total variance in the series and more importantly a number of underlying market periodicities reliable identification of any periodicities is extremely important for options pricing and risk management and we believe that ssa can be a useful addition to the financial practitioners toolbox phase control of higherorder squeezing of a quantum field in a recent experiment phys rev lett 88 2002 023601 phasedependent photon statistics in a cw system has been observed in the mixing of a coherent field with a twophoton source their system has the advantage over other atomic transitionbased fluorescent systems in this paper we examine further the squeezing properties of higherorder quantum fluctuations in one of the quadrature components of the combined field in this system we demonstrate that efficient and lasting higherorder squeezing effects could be observed with proper choice of the relative phase between the pump and coherent fields this nonclassical feature is attributed to a constructive twophoton interference relationship between the second and higherorder squeezing of the field is discussed modeling selfconsistent multiclass dynamic traffic flow in this study we present a systematic selfconsistent multiclass multilane traffic model derived from the vehicular boltzmann equation and the traffic dispersion model the multilane domain is considered as a twodimensional space and the interaction among vehicles in the domain is described by a dispersion model the reason we consider a multilane domain as a twodimensional space is that the driving behavior of road users may not be restricted by lanes especially motorcyclists the dispersion model which is a nonlinear poisson equation is derived from the carfollowing theory and the equilibrium assumption under the concept that all kinds of users share the finite section the density is distributed on a road by the dispersion model in addition the dynamic evolution of the traffic flow is determined by the systematic gaskinetic model derived from the boltzmann equation multiplying boltzmann equation by the zeroth first and secondorder moment functions integrating both side of the equation and using chain rules we can derive continuity motion and variance equation respectively however the secondorder moment function which is the square of the individual velocity is employed by previous researches does not have physical meaning in traffic flow mixture of experts classification using a hierarchical mixture model a threelevel hierarchical mixture model for classification is presented that models the following data generation process 1 the data are generated by a finite number of sources clusters and 2 the generation mechanism of each source assumes the existence of individual internal classlabeled sources subclusters of the external cluster the model estimates the posterior probability of class membership similar to a mixture of experts classifier in order to learn the parameters of the model we have developed a general training approach based on maximum likelihood that results in two efficient training algorithms compared to other classification mixture models the proposed hierarchical model exhibits several advantages and provides improved classification performance as indicated by the experimental results emarketing restaurant web sites that click a number of global companies have adopted electronic commerce as a means of reducing transaction related expenditures connecting with current and potential customers and enhancing revenues and profitability if a restaurant is to have an internet presence what aspects of the business should be highlighted food service companies that have successfully ventured onto the web have employed assorted webbased technologies to create a powerful marketing tool of unparalleled strength historically it has been difficult to create a set of criteria against which to evaluate website effectiveness as practitioners consider additional resources for website development the effectiveness of emarketing investment becomes increasingly important care must be exercised to ensure that the quality of the site adheres to high standards and incorporates evolving technology as appropriate developing a coherent website strategy including an effective website design are proving critical to an effective web presence exploring developments in web based relationship marketing within the hotel industry this paper provides a content analysis study of the application of world wide web marketing by the hotel industry there is a lack of historical perspective on industry related web marketing applications and this paper attempts to resolve this with a twoyear followup case study of the changing use of the web to develop different types of relationships specifically the aims are 1 to identify key changes in the way hotels are using the web 2 to look for evidence of the adoption of a relationship marketing rm model as a strategy for the development of hotel web sites and the use of new technologies and 3 to investigate the use of multimedia in hotel web sites the development and strategic exploitation of the internet has transformed the basis of marketing using the evidence from a web content survey this study reveals the way relationships are being created and managed within the hotel industry by its use of the web as a marketing tool the authors have collected evidence by means of a descriptive study on the way hotels build and create relationships with their web presence delivering multimedia information as well as channel and interactive means of communication in addition a strategic framework is offered as the means to describe the mechanism and orientation of web based marketing by hotels the study utilizes a model by gilbert 1996 as a means of developing a measurement instrument to allow a content analysis of the current approach by hotels to the development of web sites the results indicate hotels are aware of the new uses of web technology and are promoting hotel products in the global electronic market in new and sophisticated ways online auctions dynamic pricing and the lodging industry the traditional channels of distribution for overnight accommodation are rapidly being displaced by web site scripting online intermediaries and specialty brokers businesses that pioneered internet usage relied on it as a sales and marketing alternative to predecessor product distribution channels as such web sites replace the traditional trading model to the internet webenabled companies are popular because the medium renders the process faster less costly highly reliable and secure auctionbased models impact business models by converting the price setting mechanism from suppliercentric to marketcentric and transforming the trading model from one to many to many to many historically pricing was based on the cost of production plus a margin of profit traditionally as products and services move through the supply chain from the producer to the consumer various intermediaries added their share of profit to the price as internet based mediums of distribution become more prevalent traditional pricing models are being supplanted with dynamic pricing a dynamic pricing model represents a flexible system that changes prices not only from product to product but also from customer to customer and transaction to transaction many industry leaders are skeptical of the long run impact of online auctions on lodging industry profit margins despite the fact pricing theory suggests that an increase in the flow of information results in efficient market pricing the future of such endeavors remains promising but controversial affine invariants of convex polygons in this correspondence we prove that the affine invariants for image registration and object recognition proposed recently by yang and cohen see ibid vol8 no7 p93446 july 1999 are algebraically dependent we show how to select an independent and complete set of the invariants the use of this new set leads to a significant reduction of the computing complexity without decreasing the discrimination power realtime implementation of a new lowmemory spiht image coding algorithm using dsp chip among all algorithms based on wavelet transform and zerotree quantization said and pearlmans 1996 set partitioning in hierarchical trees spiht algorithm is wellknown for its simplicity and efficiency this paper deals with the realtime implementation of spiht algorithm using dsp chip in order to facilitate the implementation and improve the codecs performance some relative issues are thoroughly discussed such as the optimization of program structure to speed up the wavelet decomposition spihts high memory requirement is a major drawback for hardware implementation in this paper we modify the original spiht algorithm by presenting two new conceptsnumber of error bits and absolute zerotree consequently the memory cost is significantly reduced we also introduce a new method to control the coding process by number of error bits our experimental results show that the implementation meets common requirement of realtime video coding and is proven to be a practical and efficient dsp solution efficient computation of local geometric moments local moments have attracted attention as local features in applications such as edge detection and texture segmentation the main reason for this is that they are inherently integralbased features so that their use reduces the effect of uncorrelated noise the computation of local moments when viewed as a neighborhood operation can be interpreted as a convolution of the image with a set of masks nevertheless moments computed inside overlapping windows are not independent and convolution does not take this fact into account by introducing a matrix formulation and the concept of accumulation moments this paper presents an algorithm which is computationally much more efficient than convolving and yet as simple adaptive image denoising using scale and space consistency this paper proposes a new method for image denoising with edge preservation based on image multiresolution decomposition by a redundant wavelet transform in our approach edges are implicitly located and preserved in the wavelet domain whilst image noise is filtered out at each resolution level the image edges are estimated by gradient magnitudes obtained from the wavelet coefficients which are modeled probabilistically and a shrinkage function is assembled based on the model obtained joint use of space and scale consistency is applied for better preservation of edges the shrinkage functions are combined to preserve edges that appear simultaneously at several resolutions and geometric constraints are applied to preserve edges that are not isolated the proposed technique produces a filtered version of the original image where homogeneous regions appear separated by welldefined edges possible applications include image presegmentation and image denoising tracking nonparameterized object contours in video we propose a new method for contour tracking in video the inverted distance transform of the edge map is used as an edge indicator function for contour detection using the concept of topographical distance the watershed segmentation can be formulated as a minimization this new viewpoint gives a way to combine the results of the watershed algorithm on different surfaces in particular our algorithm determines the contour as a combination of the current edge map and the contour predicted from the tracking result in the previous frame we also show that the problem of background clutter can be relaxed by taking the object motion into account the compensation with object motion allows to detect and remove spurious edges in background the experimental results confirm the expected advantages of the proposed method over the existing approaches multilayered image representation application to image compression the main contribution of this work is a new paradigm for image representation and image compression we describe a new multilayered representation technique for images an image is parsed into a superposition of coherent layers piecewise smooth regions layer textures layer etc the multilayered decomposition algorithm consists in a cascade of compressions applied successively to the image itself and to the residuals that resulted from the previous compressions during each iteration of the algorithm we code the residual part in a lossy way we only retain the most significant structures of the residual part which results in a sparse representation each layer is encoded independently with a different transform or basis at a different bitrate and the combination of the compressed layers can always be reconstructed in a meaningful way the strength of the multilayer approach comes from the fact that different sets of basis functions complement each others some of the basis functions will give reasonable account of the large trend of the data while others will catch the local transients or the oscillatory patterns this multilayered representation has a lot of beautiful applications in image understanding and image and video coding we have implemented the algorithm and we have studied its capabilities combining spatial and scalespace techniques for edge detection to provide a spatially adaptive waveletbased noise filtering algorithm new methods for detecting edges in an image using spatial and scalespace domains are proposed a priori knowledge about geometrical characteristics of edges is used to assign a probability factor to the chance of any pixel being on an edge an improved double thresholding technique is introduced for spatial domain filtering probabilities that pixels belong to a given edge are assigned based on pixel similarity across gradient amplitudes gradient phases and edge connectivity the scalespace approach uses dynamic range compression to allow wavelet correlation over a wider range of scales a probabilistic formulation is used to combine the results obtained from filtering in each domain to provide a final edge probability image which has the advantages of both spatial and scalespace domain methods decomposing this edge probability image with the same wavelet as the original image permits the generation of adaptive filters that can recognize the characteristics of the edges in all wavelet detail and approximation images regardless of scale these matched filters permit significant reduction in image noise without contributing to edge distortion the spatially adaptive wavelet noisefiltering algorithm is qualitatively and quantitatively compared to a frequency domain and two wavelet based noise suppression algorithms using both natural and computer generated noisy images computational capacity of an odorant discriminator the linear separability of curves we introduce and study an artificial neural network inspired by the probabilistic receptor affinity distribution model of olfaction our system consists of n sensory neurons whose outputs converge on a single processing linear threshold element the systems aim is to model discrimination of a single target odorant from a large number p of background odorants within a range of odorant concentrations we show that this is possible provided p does not exceed a critical value psub c and calculate the critical capacity alpha cpsub cn the critical capacity depends on the range of concentrations in which the discrimination is to be accomplished if the olfactory bulb may be thought of as a collection of such processing elements each responsible for the discrimination of a single odorant our study provides a quantitative analysis of the potential computational properties of the olfactory bulb the mathematical formulation of the problem we consider is one of determining the capacity for linear separability of continuous curves embedded in a largedimensional space this is accomplished here by a numerical study using a method that signals whether the discrimination task is realizable together with a finitesize scaling analysis lossy to lossless objectbased coding of 3d mri data we propose a fully threedimensional 3d objectbased coding system exploiting the diagnostic relevance of the different regions of the volumetric data for rate allocation the data are first decorrelated via a 3d discrete wavelet transform the implementation via the lifting steps scheme allows to map integertointeger values enabling lossless coding and facilitates the definition of the objectbased inverse transform the coding process assigns disjoint segments of the bitstream to the different objects which can be independently accessed and reconstructed at any uptolossless quality two fully 3d coding strategies are considered embedded zerotree coding ezw3d and multidimensional layered zero coding mlzc both generalized for region of interest roibased processing in order to avoid artifacts along region boundaries some extra coefficients must be encoded for each object this gives rise to an overheading of the bitstream with respect to the case where the volume is encoded as a whole the amount of such extra information depends on both the filter length and the decomposition depth the system is characterized on a set of head magnetic resonance images results show that mlzc and ezw3d have competitive performances in particular the best mlzc mode outperforms the others stateoftheart techniques on one of the datasets

important control center functions security control and loadfollowing control guarantee the continuity of electric service which after all is the endproduct of the utility business new technology trends in the design of control center infrastructures are emerging in the liberalized environment of the energy market an example of a control center infrastructure is described the article ends with a concern for the security of the control center itself virus hunting we all appreciate the need for and hopefully we have all deployed antivirus software the good news is that av software has come a long way fast four or so years ago it was true to write that av software could not detect trojan horses and similar intrusion attempts now it can and does mcafees virusscan for example goes one further it detects viruses worms and trojan horses and deploys itself as a firewall to filter data packets control access to internet resources activate rule sets for specific applications in general to protect against hackers but like so much software we use it with little thought as to how it came to do its job behind the scenes there is an army of top notch programmers trying to stay ahead of

organisations have invested in the latest software applications to drive their business forward but many are now finding that these systems are becoming redundant on their own the key to staying ahead

both a key responsibility and opportunity for management services practitioners on optimality in auditory information processing we study limits for the detection and estimation of weak sinusoidal signals in the primary part of the mammalian auditory system using a stochastic fitzhughnagumo model and an actionrecovery model for synaptic depression our overall model covers the chain from a hair cell to a point just after the synaptic connection with a cell in the cochlear nucleus the information processing performance of the system is evaluated using socalled phi divergences from statistics that quantify dissimilarity between probability measures and are intimately related to a number of fundamental limits in statistics and information theory it we show that there exists a set of parameters that can optimize several important phi divergences simultaneously and that this set corresponds to a constant quiescent firing rate qfr of the spiral ganglion neuron the optimal value of the qfr is frequency dependent but is essentially independent of the amplitude of the signal for small amplitudes consequently optimal processing according to several standard it criteria can be accomplished for this model if and only if the parameters are tuned to values that correspond to one and the same qfr this offers a new explanation for the qfr and can provide new insight into the role played by several other parameters of the peripheral auditory system electrical facility construction work for information network structuring by the use of sewage conduits to confront the advent of the advanced information society there has been a pressing demand for the adjustment of the communications infrastructure and the structuring of the information network by utilizing the sewage conduits the city of tokyo is promoting a project by the name of the sewer optical fiber teleway soft network plan according to this plan the total distance of the optical fiber network laid in the sewer conduits is scheduled to reach about 470 km by the end of march 2000 at the final stage this distance will reach 800 km as a whole we completed the construction work for the information control facilities scattered in 11 places inclusive of the treatment site s with the intention to adjust and extend the information transmission network laid through the abovementioned optical fiber network to be used exclusively by the bureau of sewerage this construction work is described in the paper a framework for evaluating the datahiding capacity of image sources an informationtheoretic model for image watermarking and data hiding is presented in this paper previous theoretical results are used to characterize the fundamental capacity limits of image watermarking and datahiding systems capacity is determined by the statistical model used for the host image by the distortion constraints on the data hider and the attacker and by the information available to the data hider to the attacker and to the decoder we consider autoregressive blockdct and wavelet statistical models for images and compute datahiding capacity for compressed and uncompressed hostimage sources closedform expressions are obtained under sparsemodel approximations models for geometric attacks and distortion measures that are invariant to such attacks are considered geometrically invariant watermarking using feature points this paper presents a new approach for watermarking of digital images providing robustness to geometrical distortions the weaknesses of classical watermarking methods to geometrical distortions are outlined first geometrical distortions can be decomposed into two classes global transformations such as rotations and translations and local transformations such as the stirmark attack an overview of existing selfsynchronizing schemes is then presented theses schemes can use periodical properties of the mark invariant properties of transforms template insertion or information provided by the original image to counter geometrical distortions thereafter a new class of watermarking schemes using the image content is presented we propose an embedding and detection scheme where the mark is bound with a content descriptor defined by salient points three different types of feature points are studied and their robustness to geometrical transformations is evaluated to develop an enhanced detector the embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a delaunay tessellation on the set of points the mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation the detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles the performance of the presented scheme is evaluated after jpeg compression geometrical attack and transformations results show that the fact that the scheme is robust to these different manipulations finally in our concluding remarks we analyze the different perspectives of such contentbased watermarking scheme color plane interpolation using alternating projections most commercial digital cameras use color filter arrays to sample red green and blue colors according to a specific pattern at the location of each pixel only one color sample is taken and the values of the other colors must be interpolated using neighboring samples this color plane interpolation is known as demosaicing it is one of the important tasks in a digital camera pipeline if demosaicing is not performed appropriately images suffer from highly visible color artifacts in this paper we present a new demosaicing technique that uses interchannel correlation effectively in an alternatingprojections scheme we have compared this technique with six stateoftheart demosaicing techniques and it outperforms all of them both visually and in terms of mean square error a comparison of computational color constancy algorithms ii experiments with image data for pti see ibid vol 11 no9 p97284 2002 we test a number of the leading computational color constancy algorithms using a comprehensive set of images these were of 33 different scenes under 11 different sources representative of common illumination conditions the algorithms studied include two gray world methods a version of the retinex method several variants of forsyths 1990 gamutmapping method cardei et als 2000 neural net method and finlayson et als color by correlation method finlayson et al 1997 2001 hubel and finlayson 2000 we discuss a number of issues in applying color constancy ideas to image data and study in depth the effect of different preprocessing strategies we compare the performance of the algorithms on image data with their performance on synthesized data all data used for this study are available online at httpwwwcssfucacolordata and implementations for most of the algorithms are also available httpwwwcssfucacolorcode experiments with synthesized data part one of this paper suggested that the methods which emphasize the use of the input data statistics specifically color by correlation and the neural net algorithm are potentially the most effective at estimating the chromaticity of the scene illuminant unfortunately we were unable to realize comparable performance on real images here exploiting pixel intensity proved to be more beneficial than exploiting the details of image chromaticity statistics and the threedimensional 3d gamutmapping algorithms gave the best performance a comparison of computational color constancy algorithms i methodology and experiments with synthesized data we introduce a context for testing computational color constancy specify our approach to the implementation of a number of the leading algorithms and report the results of three experiments using synthesized data experiments using synthesized data are important because the ground truth is known possible confounds due to camera characterization and preprocessing are absent and various factors affecting color constancy can be efficiently investigated because they can be manipulated individually and precisely the algorithms chosen for close study include two gray world methods a limiting case of a version of the retinex method a number of variants of forsyths 1990 gamutmapping method cardei et als 2000 neural net method and finlayson et als color by correlation method finlayson et al 1997 2001 hubel and finlayson 2000  we investigate the ability of these algorithms to make estimates of three different color constancy quantities the chromaticity of the scene illuminant the overall magnitude of that illuminant and a corrected illumination invariant image we consider algorithm performance as a function of the number of surfaces in scenes generated from reflectance spectra the relative effect on the algorithms of added specularities and the effect of subsequent clipping of the data all data is available online at httpwwwcssfucacolordata and implementations for most of the algorithms are also available httpwwwcssfucacolorcode quality image metrics for synthetic images based on perceptual color differences due to the improvement of image rendering processes and the increasing importance of quantitative comparisons among synthetic color images it is essential to define perceptually based metrics which enable to objectively assess the visual quality of digital simulations in response to this need this paper proposes a new methodology for the determination of an objective image quality metric and gives an answer to this problem through three metrics this methodology is based on the llab color space for perception of color in complex images a modification of the cielab1976 color space the first metric proposed is a pixel by pixel metric which introduces a local distance map between two images the second metric associates to a pair of images a global value finally the third metric uses a recursive subdivision of the images to obtain an adaptative distance map rougher but less expensive to compute than the first method exact controllability of shells in minimal time we prove an exact controllability result for thin cups using the fourier method and recent improvements of ingham 1936 type theorems a friction compensator for pneumatic control valves a procedure that compensates for static friction stiction in pneumatic control valves is presented the compensation is obtained by adding pulses to the control signal the characteristics of the pulses are determined from the control action the compensator is implemented in industrial controllers and control systems and the industrial experiences show that the procedure reduces the control error during stickslip motion significantly compared to standard control without stiction compensation performance comparison between pid and deadtime compensating controllers this paper is intended to answer the question when can a simple deadtime compensator be expected to perform better than a pid the performance criterion used is the integrated absolute error iae it is compared for pi and pid controllers and a simple deadtime compensator dtc when a step load disturbance is applied at the plant input both stable and integrating processes are considered for a fair comparison the controllers should provide equal robustness in some sense here as a measure of robustness the hsub infinity  norm of the sum of the absolute values of the sensitivity function and the complementary sensitivity function is used performance of the dtcs is given also as a function of deadtime margin dsub m waiting for the wave to crest wavelength services wavelength services have been hyped ad nauseam for years but despite their quick turnup time and impressive margins such services have yet to live up to the industrys expectations the reasons for this lukewarm reception are many not the least of which is the confusion that still surrounds the technology but most industry observers are still convinced that wavelength services with ultimately flourish adaptive state feedback control for a class of linear systems with unknown bounds of uncertainties the problem of adaptive robust stabilization for a class of linear timevarying systems with disturbance and nonlinear uncertainties is considered the bounds of the disturbance and uncertainties are assumed to be unknown being even arbitrary for such uncertain dynamical systems the adaptive robust state feedback controller is obtained and the resulting closedloop systems are asymptotically stable in theory moreover an adaptive robust state feedback control scheme is given the scheme ensures the closedloop systems exponentially practically stable and can be used in practical engineering finally simulations show that the control scheme is effective preintegration lateral inhibition enhances unsupervised learning a large and influential class of neural network architectures uses postintegration lateral inhibition as a mechanism for competition we argue that these algorithms are computationally deficient in that they fail to generate or learn appropriate perceptual representations under certain circumstances an alternative neural network architecture is presented here in which nodes compete for the right to receive inputs rather than for the right to generate outputs this form of competition implemented through preintegration lateral inhibition does provide appropriate coding properties and can be used to learn such representations efficiently furthermore this architecture is consistent with both neuroanatomical and neuropsychological data we thus argue that preintegration lateral inhibition has computational advantages over conventional neural network architectures while remaining equally biologically plausible generalized predictive control for nonuniformly sampled systems in this paper we study digital control systems with nonuniform updating and sampling patterns which include multirate sampleddata systems as special cases we derive lifted models in the statespace domain the main obstacle for generalized predictive control gpc design using the lifted models is the socalled causality constraint taking into account this design constraint we propose a new gpc algorithm which results in optimal causal control laws for the nonuniformly sampled systems the solution applies immediately to multirate sampleddata systems where rates are integer multiples of some base period a simple graphic approach for observer decomposition based upon the proposition that the roles of inputs and outputs in a physical system and those in the corresponding outputinjection observer do not really have to be consistent a systematic procedure is developed in this work to properly divide a set of sparse system models and measurement models into a number of independent subsets with the help of a visual aid several smaller subobservers can then be constructed accordingly to replace the original one the size of each subobserver may be further reduced by strategically selecting one or more appended states these techniques are shown to be quite effective in relieving online computation load of the outputinjection observers and also in identifying detectable subsystems a new subspace identification approach based on principal component analysis principal component analysis pca has been widely used for monitoring complex industrial processes with multiple variables and diagnosing process and sensor faults the objective of this paper is to develop a new subspace identification algorithm that gives consistent model estimates under the errorsinvariables eiv situation in this paper we propose a new subspace identification approach using principal component analysis pca naturally falls into the category of eiv formulation which resembles total least squares and allows for errors in both process input and output we propose to use pca to determine the system observability subspace the matrices and the system order for an eiv formulation standard pca is modified with instrumental variables in order to achieve consistent estimates of the system matrices the proposed subspace identification method is demonstrated using a simulated process and a real industrial process for model identification and order determination for comparison the moesp algorithm and n4sid algorithm are used as benchmarks to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed pca based subspace model identification smi algorithm nonlinear modeling and adaptive fuzzy control of mcfc stack to improve availability and performance of fuel cells the operating temperature of the molten carbonate fuel cells mcfc stack should be controlled within a specified range however most existing models of mcfc are not ready to be applied in synthesis in the paper a radial basis function neural networks identification model of a mcfc stack is developed based on the inputoutput sampled data an adaptive fuzzy control procedure for the temperature of the mcfc stack is also developed the parameters of the fuzzy control system are regulated by backpropagation algorithm and the rule database of the fuzzy system is also adaptively adjusted by the nearestneighborclustering algorithm finally using the neural networks model of mcfc stack the simulation results of the control algorithm are presented the results show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and design procedures for the mcfc stack

semiautomatic segmentation of medical 3d volume data the mousebased manual initialization of deformable surfaces in 3d represents a major bottleneck in interactive segmentation in our multimodal system we enhance this process with additional sensory feedback a 3d haptic device is used to extract the centreline of a tubular structure based on the obtained path a cylinder with varying diameter is generated which in turn is used as the initial guess for a deformable surface stateoftheart in orthopaedic surgical navigation with a focus on medical image modalities this paper presents a review of surgical navigation systems in orthopaedics and categorizes these systems according to the image modalities that are used for the visualization of surgical action medical images used to be an essential part of surgical education and documentation as well as diagnosis and operation planning over many years with the recent introduction of navigation techniques in orthopaedic surgery a new field of application has been opened today surgical navigation systems  also known as imageguided surgery systems  are available for various applications in orthopaedic surgery they visualize the position and orientation of surgical instruments as graphical overlays onto a medical image of the operated anatomy on a computer monitor preoperative image data such as computed tomography scans or intra operatively generated images for example ultrasonic endoscopic or fluoroscopic images are suitable for this purpose a new category of medical images termed surgeondefined anatomy has been developed that exclusively relies upon the usage of navigation technology points on the anatomy are digitized interactively by the surgeon and are used to build up an abstract geometrical model of the bony structures to be operated on this technique may be used when no other image data is available or appropriate for a given application lung metastasis detection and visualization on ct images a knowledgebased method a solution to the problem of lung metastasis detection on computed tomography ct scans of the thorax is presented a knowledgebased topdown approach for image interpretation is used the method is inspired by the manner in which a radiologist and radiotherapist interpret ct images before radiotherapy is planned a twodimensional followed by a threedimensional analysis is performed the algorithm first detects the thorax contour the lungs and the ribs which further help the detection of metastases thus two types of tumors are detected nodules and metastases located at the lung extremities a method to visualize the anatomical structures segmented is also presented the system was tested on 20 patients 988 total images from the oncology department of la chauxdefonds hospital and the results show that the method is reliable as a computeraided diagnostic tool for clinical purpose in an oncology department the creation of a highfidelity finite element model of the kidney for use in trauma research a detailed finite element model of the human kidney for trauma research has been created directly from the national library of medicine visible human female vhf project data set an image segmentation and organ reconstruction software package has been developed and employed to transform the 2d vhf images into a 3d polygonal representation nonuniform rational bspline nurbs surfaces were then mapped to the polygonal surfaces and were finally utilized to create a robust 3d hexahedral finite element mesh within a commercially available meshing software the model employs a combined viscoelastic and hyperelastic material model to successfully simulate the behaviour of biological soft tissues the finite element model was then validated for use in biomechanical research building 3d anatomical scenes on the web we propose a new service for building userdefined 3d anatomical structures on the web the web server is connected to a database storing more than 1000 3d anatomical models reconstructed from the visible human users may combine existing models as well as planar oblique slices in order to create their own structured anatomical scenes furthermore they may record sequences of scene construction and visualization actions these actions enable the server to construct highquality video animations downloadable by the user professionals and students in anatomy medicine and related disciplines are invited to use the server and create their own anatomical scenes a survey of interactive meshcutting techniques and a new method for implementing generalized interactive mesh cutting using virtual tools in our experience meshcutting methods can be distinguished by how their solutions address the following major issues definition of the cut path primitive removal and remeshing number of new primitives created when remeshing is performed and representation of the cutting tool many researchers have developed schemes for interactive mesh cutting with the goals of reducing the number of new primitives created creating new primitives with good aspect ratios avoiding a disconnected mesh structure between primitives in the cut path and representing the path traversed by the tool as accurately as possible the goal of this paper is to explain how by using a very simple framework one can build a generalized cutting scheme this method allows for any arbitrary cut to be made within a virtual object and can simulate cutting surface layered surface or tetrahedral objects using a virtual scalpel scissors or loop cautery tool this method has been implemented in a realtime hapticrate surgical simulation system allowing arbitrary cuts to be made on highresolution patientspecific models correction to construction of panoramic image mosaics with global and local alignment for original paper see ibid vol 36 no 2 p 10130 2000 the authors had given a method for the construction of panoramic image mosaics with global and local alignment unfortunately a mistake had led to an incorrect equation which whilst making little difference in many cases for faster and assured convergence the correct formulae given here should be used scaleinvariant segmentation of dynamic contrastenhanced perfusion mr images with inherent scale selection selection of the best set of scales is problematic when developing signaldriven approaches for pixelbased image segmentation often different possibly conflicting criteria need to be fulfilled in order to obtain the best tradeoff between uncertainty variance and location accuracy the optimal set of scales depends on several factors the noise level present in the image material the prior distribution of the different types of segments the classconditional distributions associated with each type of segment as well as the actual size of the connected segments we analyse theoretically and through experiments the possibility of using the overall and classconditional error rates as criteria for selecting the optimal sampling of the linear and morphological scale spaces it is shown that the overall error rate is optimized by taking the prior class distribution in the image material into account however a uniform ignorant prior distribution ensures constant classconditional error rates consequently we advocate for a uniform prior class distribution when an uncommitted scaleinvariant segmentation approach is desired experiments with a neural net classifier developed for segmentation of dynamic magnetic resonance mr images acquired with a paramagnetic tracer support the theoretical results furthermore the experiments show that the addition of spatial features to the classifier extracted from the linear or morphological scale spaces improves the segmentation result compared to a signaldriven approach based solely on the dynamic mr signal the segmentation results obtained from the two types of features are compared using two novel quality measures that characterize spatial properties of labelled images innovative phase unwrapping algorithm hybrid approach we present a novel algorithm based on a hybrid of the global and local treatment of a wrapped map the proposed algorithm is especially effective for the unwrapping of specklecoded interferogram contour maps in contrast to earlier unwrapping algorithms by region we propose a local discontinuityrestoring criterion to serve as the preprocessor or postprocessor of our hybrid algorithm which makes the unwrapping by region much easier and more efficient with this hybrid algorithm a robust stable and especially time effective phase unwrapping can be achieved additionally the criterion and limitation of this hybrid algorithm are fully described the robustness stability and speed of this hybrid algorithm are also studied the proposed algorithm can be easily upgraded with minor modifications to solve the unwrapping problem of maps with phase inconsistency both numerical simulation and experimental applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm strain contouring using gabor filters principle and algorithm moire interferometry is a powerful technique for high sensitivity inplane deformation contouring however from an engineering viewpoint the derivatives of displacement ie strain are the desired parameter thus there is a need to differentiate the displacement field optical and digital methods have been proposed for this differentiation optical methods provide contours that still need to be quantified while digital methods suffer from drawbacks inherent in the digital differentiation process we describe a novel approach of strain segmentation for the moire pattern using a multichannel gabor filter appropriate filter design allows for userspecific segmentation which is essentially in engineering design and analysis novel denoising algorithm for obtaining a superresolved position estimation we present a new algorithm that uses the randomness of the noise pattern to achieve high positioning accuracy by applying a modified averaging operation using the suggested approach noise sensitivity of the positioning accuracy can be significantly reduced this new improved algorithm can improve the performances of tracking systems used for military as well as civil applications the concept is demonstrated theoretically as well as by optical experiment adaptive filtering for noise reduction in hue saturation intensity color space even though the hue saturation intensity hsi color model has been widely used in color image processing and analysis the conversion formulas from the rgb color model to hsi are nonlinear and complicated in comparison with the conversion formulas of other color models when an rgb image is degraded by random gaussian noise this nonlinearity leads to a nonuniform noise distribution in hsi making accurate image analysis more difficult we have analyzed the noise characteristics of the hsi color model and developed an adaptive spatial filtering method to reduce the magnitude of noise and the nonuniformity of noise variance in the hsi color space with this adaptive filtering method the filter kernel for each pixel is dynamically adjusted depending on the values of intensity and saturation in our experiments we have filtered the saturation and hue components and generated edge maps from color gradients we have found that by using the adaptive filtering method the minimum error rate in edge detection improves by approximately 15 optical recognition of threedimensional objects with scale invariance using a classical convergent correlator we present a realtime method for recognizing threedimensional 3d objects with scale invariance the 3d information of the objects is codified in deformed fringe patterns using the fourier transform profilometry technique and is correlated using a classical convergent correlator the scale invariance property is achieved using two different approaches the mellin radial harmonic decomposition and the logarithmic radial harmonic filter thus the method is invariant for changes in the scale of the 3d target within a defined interval of scale factors experimental results show the utility of the proposed method fully automatic algorithm for region of interest location in camera calibration we present an automatic method for region of interest roi location in camera calibration used in computer vision inspection an intelligent roi location algorithm based on the radon transform is developed to automate the calibration process the algorithm remains robust even if the anchor target has a notable rotation angle in the target plane this method functions well although the anchor target is not carefully positioned several improvement methods are studied to avoid the algorithms huge timespace consumption problem the algorithm runs about 100 times faster if these improvement methods are applied using this method fully automatic camera calibration is achieved without human interactive roi specification experiments show that this algorithm can help to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of the zoom lens and the camera parameters quickly and automatically autofocus system for microscope a technique is developed for microscope autofocusing which is called the eccentric light beam approach with high resolution wide focusing range and compact construction the principle is described the theoretical formula of the eccentric light beam approach deduced can be applied not only to an object lens whose objective plane is just at the focal plane but also to an object lens whose objective plane is not at the focal plane the experimental setup uses a semiconductor laser device as the light source the laser beam that enters into the microscope is eccentric with the main light axis a defocused signal is acquired by a symmetrical silicon photocell for the change of the reflected light position caused by differential amplification and processed by a microprocessor then the electric signal is poweramplified and drives a dc motor which moves a fine working platform to an automatic focus of the microscope the result of the experiments shows a or01 mu m precision of autofocusing for a range of or500 mu m defocusing the system has high reliability and can meet the requirements of various accurate micro measurement systems design and implementation of a 3d mapping system for highly irregular shaped objects with application to semiconductor manufacturing the basic technology for a robotic system is developed to automate the packing of polycrystalline silicon nuggets into fragile fused silica crucible in czochralski melt pulling semiconductor wafer production the highly irregular shapes of the nuggets and the packing constraints make this a difficult and challenging task it requires the delicate manipulation and packing of highly irregular polycrystalline silicon nuggets into a fragile fused silica crucible for this application a dual optical 3d surface mapping system that uses active laser triangulation has been developed and successfully tested one part of the system measures the geometry profile of a nugget being packed and the other the profile of the nuggets already in the crucible a resolution of 1 mm with 15khz sampling frequency is achieved data from the system are used by the packing algorithm which determines optimal nugget placement the key contribution is to describe the design and implementation of an efficient and robust 3d imaging system to map highly irregular shaped objects using conventional components in context of real commercial manufacturing processes effective moving cast shadow detection for monocular color traffic image sequences for an accurate scene analysis using monocular color traffic image sequences a robust segmentation of moving vehicles from the stationary background is generally required however the presence of moving cast shadow may lead to an inaccurate vehicle segmentation and as a result may lead to further erroneous scene analysis we propose an effective method for the detection of moving cast shadow by observing the characteristics of cast shadow in the luminance chrominance gradient density and geometry domains a combined probability map called a shadow confidence score scs is obtained from the edge map of the input image each edge pixel is examined to determine whether it belongs to the vehicle region based on its neighboring scss the cast shadow is identified as those regions with high scss which are outside the convex hull of the selected vehicle edge pixels the proposed method is tested on 100 vehicle images taken under different lighting conditions sunny and cloudy viewing angles roadside and overhead vehicle sizes small medium and large and colors similar to the road and not the results indicate that an average error rate of around 14 is obtained while the lowest error rate is around 3 for large vehicles estimation of error in curvature computation on multiscale freeform surfaces a novel technique for multiscale curvature computation on a freeform 3d surface is presented this is achieved by convolving local parametrisations of the surface with 2d gaussian filters iteratively in our technique semigeodesic coordinates are constructed at each vertex of the mesh smoothing results are shown for 3d surfaces with different shapes indicating that surface noise is eliminated and surface details are removed gradually a number of evolution properties of 3d surfaces are described next the surface gaussian and mean curvature values are estimated accurately at multiple scales which are then mapped to colours and displayed directly on the surface the performance of the technique when selecting different directions as an arbitrary direction for the geodesic at each vertex are also presented the results indicate that the error observed for the estimation of gaussian and mean curvatures is quite low after only one iteration furthermore as the surface is smoothed iteratively the error is further reduced the results also show that the estimation error of gaussian curvature is less than that of mean curvature our experiments demonstrate that estimation of smoothed surface curvatures are very accurate and not affected by the arbitrary direction of the first geodesic line when constructing semigeodesic coordinates our technique is independent of the underlying triangulation and is also more efficient than volumetric diffusion techniques since 2d rather than 3d convolutions are employed finally the method presented here is a generalisation of the curvature scale space method for 2d contours the css method has outperformed comparable techniques within the mpeg7 evaluation framework as a result it has been selected for inclusion in the mpeg7 package of standards restoration of broadband imagery steered with a liquidcrystal optical phased array in many imaging applications it is highly desirable to replace mechanical beamsteering components ie mirrors and gimbals with a nonmechanical device one such device is a nematic liquid crystal optical phased array lcopa an lcopa can implement a blazed phase grating to steer the incident light however when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system two adverse effects can occur first dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane second the device will steer energy not only to the first diffraction order but to others as well this multipleorder effect results in multiple copies of the scene appearing in the image plane we describe a digital image restoration technique designed to overcome these degradations the proposed postprocessing technique is based on a wiener deconvolution filter the technique however is applicable only to scenes containing objects with approximately constant reflectivities over the spectral region of interest experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique onestep digitsetrestricted modified signeddigit adder using an incoherent correlator based on a shared contentaddressable memory an efficient onestep digitsetrestricted modified signeddigit msd adder based on symbolic substitution is presented in this technique carry propagation is avoided by introducing reference digits to restrict the intermediate carry and sum digits to 10 and 01 respectively the proposed technique requires significantly fewer minterms and simplifies system complexity compared to the reported onestep msd addition techniques an incoherent correlator based on an optoelectronic shared contentaddressable memory processor is suggested to perform the addition operation in this technique only one set of minterms needs to be stored independent of the operand length twostep integral imaging for orthoscopic threedimensional imaging with improved viewing resolution we present a twostep integral imaging system to obtain 3d orthoscopic real images by adopting a nonstationary microoptics technique we demonstrate experimentally the potential usefulness of twostep integral imaging diffraction limit for a circular mask with a periodic rectangular apertures array a mask with periodic apertures imaging system is adopted very widely and plays a leading role in modern technology for uses such as pinhole cameras coded imaging systems optical information processing etc because of its high resolution its infinite depth of focus and its usefulness over a broad frequency spectra ranging from visible light to xrays and gamma rays while the masks with periodic apertures investigated in the literature are limited only to farfield diffraction they do not take the shift of apertures within the mask into consideration therefore the derivation of the farfield diffraction for a single aperture cannot be applied to a mask with periodic apertures the farfield diffraction formula modified for a multiaperture mask has been proposed in the past the analysis remains too complicated to offer some practical guidance for mask design we study a circular mask with periodic rectangular apertures and develop an easier way to interpret it first the nearfield diffraction intensity of a circular aperture is calculated by means of lommels function then the convolution of the circular mask diffraction with periodic rectangular apertures is put together and we can present a simple mathematical tool to analyze the mask properties including the intensity distribution blurring aberration and the criterion of defining the far or nearfield diffraction this concept can also be expanded to analyze different types of masks with the arbitrarily shaped apertures binocular model for figureground segmentation in translucent and occluding images a fourierbased solution to the problem of figureground segmentation in short baseline binocular image pairs is presented each image is modeled as an additive composite of two component images that exhibit a spatial shift due to the binocular parallax the segmentation is accomplished by decoupling each fourier component in one of the resultant additive images into its two constituent phasors allocating each to its appropriate objectspecific spectrum and then reconstructing the foreground and background using the inverse fourier transform it is shown that the foreground and background shifts can be computed from the differences of the magnitudes and phases of the fourier transform of the binocular image pair while the model is based on translucent objects it also works with occluding objects multispectral color image capture using a liquid crystal tunable filter we describe the experimental setup of a multispectral color image acquisition system consisting of a professional monochrome ccd camera and a tunable filter in which the spectral transmittance can be controlled electronically we perform a spectral characterization of the acquisition system taking into account the acquisition noise to convert the camera output signals to deviceindependent color data two main approaches are proposed and evaluated one consists in applying regression methods to convert from the k camera outputs to a deviceindependent color space such as ciexyz or cielab another method is based on a spectral model of the acquisition system by inverting the model using a principal eigenvector approach we estimate the spectral reflectance of each pixel of the imaged surface iterative regularized leastmean mixednorm image restoration we develop a regularized mixednorm image restoration algorithm to deal with various types of noise a mixednorm functional is introduced which combines the least mean square lms and the least mean fourth lmf functionals as well as a smoothing functional two regularization parameters are introduced one to determine the relative importance of the lms and lmf functionals which is a function of the kurtosis and another to determine the relative importance of the smoothing functional the two parameters are chosen in such a way that the proposed functional is convex so that a unique minimizer exists an iterative algorithm is utilized for obtaining the solution and its convergence is analyzed the novelty of the proposed algorithm is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is required and the relative contributions of the lms the lmf and the smoothing functionals are adjusted based on the partially restored image experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm motion estimation using modified dynamic programming a new method for computing precise estimates of the motion vector field of moving objects in a sequence of images is proposed correspondence vectorfield computation is formulated as a matching optimization problem for multiple dynamic images the proposed method is a heuristic modification of dynamic programming applied to the 2d optimization problem motionvectorfield estimates using real movie images demonstrate good performance of the algorithm in terms of dynamic motion analysis centroid detection based on optical correlation we propose three correlationbased methods to simultaneously detect the centroids of multiple objects in an input scene the first method is based on the modulus of the moment function the second method is based on squaring the moment function and the third method works with a single intensity filter these methods are invariant to changes in the position orientation and scale of the object and result in good noisesmoothing performance we use spatial light modulators slms to directly implement the input of the image and filter information for the purpose of these approaches we present results showing simulations from different approaches and provide comparisons between opticalcorrelation and digitalmomentbased methods experimental results corresponding to an optical correlator using slms for the centroid detection are also presented block truncation image bit plane coding block truncation coding btc is a successful image compression technique due to its simple and fast computational burden the bit rate is fixed to 20 bitspixel whose performance is moderate in terms of compression ratio compared to other compression schemes such as discrete cosine transform dct vector quantization vq wavelet transform coding wtc etc two kinds of overheads are required for btc coding bit plane and quantization values respectively a new technique is presented to reduce the bit plane overhead conventional bit plane overhead is 10 bitspixel we decrease it to 0734 bitspixel while maintaining the same decoded quality as absolute moment btc ambtc does for the lena image compared to other published bit plane coding strategies the proposed method outperforms all of the existing methods plenoptic image editing this paper presents a new class of interactive image editing operations designed to maintain consistency between multiple images of a physical 3d scene the distinguishing feature of these operations is that edits to any one image propagate automatically to all other images as if the unknown 3d scene had itself been modified the modified scene can then be viewed interactively from any other camera viewpoint and under different scene illuminations the approach is useful first as a powerassist that enables a user to quickly modify many images by editing just a few and second as a means for constructing and editing imagebased scene representations by manipulating a set of photographs the approach works by extending operations like image painting scissoring and morphing so that they alter a scenes plenoptic function in a physicallyconsistent way thereby affecting scene appearance from all viewpoints simultaneously a key element in realizing these operations is a new volumetric decomposition technique for reconstructing an scenes plenoptic function from an incomplete set of camera viewpoints elimination of zeroorder diffraction in digital holography a simple method to suppress the zeroorder diffraction in the reconstructed image of digital holography is presented in this method the laplacian of a detected hologram is used instead of the hologram itself for numerical reconstruction by computing the discrete fresnel integral this method can significantly improve the image quality and give better resolution and higher accuracy of the reconstructed image the main advantages of this method are its simplicity in experimental requirements and convenience in data processing efficient twolevel image thresholding method based on bayesian formulation and the maximum entropy principle an efficient method for twolevel thresholding is proposed based on the bayes formula and the maximum entropy principle in which no assumptions of the image histogram are made an alternative criterion is derived based on maximizing entropy and used for speeding up the searching algorithm five forms of conditional probability distributionssimple linear parabola concave parabola convex and sfunctionare employed and compared to each other for optimal threshold determination the effect of precision on optimal threshold determination is discussed and a tradeoff precision epsilon 0001 is selected experimentally our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in speed from 26 to 57 times faster than the exhaustive search method adaptive digital watermarking using fuzzy logic techniques digital watermarking has been proposed for copyright protection in our digital society we propose an adaptive digital watermarking scheme based on the human visual system model and a fuzzy logic technique the fuzzy logic approach is employed to obtain the different strengths and lengths of a watermark by the local characteristics of the image in our proposed scheme in our experiments this scheme provides a more robust and imperceptible watermark optical encoding of color threedimensional correlation threedimensional 3d correlation of color images considering the color distribution as the third dimension has been shown to be useful for color pattern recognition tasks nevertheless 3d correlation cannot be directly performed on an optical correlator that can only process twodimensional 2d signals we propose a method to encode 3d functions onto 2d ones in such a way that the fourier transform and correlation of these signals that can be optically performed encode the 3d fourier transform and correlation of the 3d signals the theory for the encoding is given and experimental results obtained in an optical correlator are shown search for efficient solutions of multicriterion problems by targetlevel method the targetlevel method is considered for solving continuous multicriterion maximization problems in the first step the decisionmaker specifies a targetlevel point the desired criterion values then in the set of vector evaluations we seek points that are closest to the target point in the chebyshev metric the vector evaluations obtained in this way are in general weakly efficient to identify the efficient evaluations the second step maximizes the sum of the criteria on the set generated in step 1 we prove the relationship between the evaluations and decisions obtained by the proposed procedure on the one hand and the efficient weakly efficient evaluations and decisions on the other hand if the edgeworthpareto hull of the set of vector evaluations is convex the set of efficient vector evaluations can be approximated by the proposed method computer processing of data on mental impairments during the acute period of concussion the article presents results of computer processing of experimental information obtained from patients during the acute period of concussion a number of computational procedures are described regularization of linear regression problems the study considers robust estimation of linear regression parameters by the regularization method the pseudoinverse method and the bayesian method allowing for correlations and errors in the data regularizing algorithms are constructed and their relationship with pseudoinversion the bayesian approach and blue is investigated choice from a threeelement set some lessons of the 2000 presidential campaign in the united states we consider the behavior of four choice rules  plurality voting approval voting borda count and selfconsistent choice  when applied to choose the best option from a threeelement set it is assumed that the two main options are preferred by a large majority of the voters while the third option gets a very small number of votes and influences the election outcome only when the two main options receive a close number of votes when used to rate the main options borda count and selfconsistent choice contain terms that allow both for the strength of preferences of the voters and the rating of the main candidates by voters who vote for the third option in this way it becomes possible to determine more reliably the winner when plurality voting or approval voting produce close results an inverse problem for a model of a hierarchical structure we consider the inverse problem for the identification of the coefficient in a parabolic equation the model is applied to describe the functioning of a hierarchical structure it is also relevant for heatconduction theory unique solvability of the inverse problem is proved selfcalibration from image derivatives this study investigates the problem of estimating camera calibration parameters from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with unknown parameters where the image formation is modeled with a linear pinholecamera model the equations obtained show the flow to be separated into a component due to the translation and the calibration parameters and a component due to the rotation and the calibration parameters a set of parameters encoding the latter component is linearly related to the flow and from these parameters the calibration can be determined however as for discrete motion in general it is not possible to decouple image measurements obtained from only two frames into translational and rotational components geometrically the ambiguity takes the form of a part of the rotational component being parallel to the translational component and thus the scene can be reconstructed only up to a projective transformation in general for full calibration at least four successive image frames are necessary with the 3d rotation changing between the measurements the geometric analysis gives rise to a direct selfcalibration method that avoids computation of optical flow or point correspondences and uses only normal flow measurements new constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are formulated to relate structure and motion directly to image derivatives and on the basis of these constraints the transformation of the viewing geometry between consecutive images is estimated the calibration parameters are then estimated from the rotational components of several flow fields as the proposed technique neither requires a special set up nor needs exact correspondence it is potentially useful for the calibration of active vision systems which have to acquire knowledge about their intrinsic parameters while they perform other tasks or as a tool for analyzing image sequences in large video databases inverse problems for a mathematical model of ion exchange in a compressible ion exchanger a mathematical model of ion exchange is considered allowing for ion exchanger compression in the process of ion exchange two inverse problems are investigated for this model unique solvability is proved and numerical solution methods are proposed the efficiency of the proposed methods is demonstrated by a numerical experiment application of multiprocessor systems for computation of jets the article describes the implementation of methods for numerical solution of gasdynamic problems on a wide class of multiprocessor systems

literature on hybrid simulation of the kelvinhelmholtz instability in finitesize objects jets moving across the magnetic field in the middle of the field reversal layer interaction between a magnetized plasma flow and a cylindrical plasma source with zero own magnetic field limits for computational electromagnetics codes imposed by computer architecture the algorithmic complexity of the innermost loops that determine the complexity of algorithms in computational electromagnetics cem codes are analyzed according to their operation count and the impact of the underlying computer hardware as memory chips are much slower than arithmetic processors codes that involve a high data movement compared to the number of arithmetic operations are executed comparatively slower hence matrixmatrix multiplications are much faster than matrixvector multiplications it is seen that it is not sufficient to compare only the complexity but also the actual performance of algorithms to judge on faster execution implications involve fdtd loops lu factorizations and iterative solvers for dense matrices run times on two reference platforms namely an athlon 900 mhz and an hp pa 8600 processor verify the findings threedimensional geometrical optics code for indoor propagation this paper presents a program go 3d for computing the fields of a transmitter in an indoor environment using geometrical optics the program uses an image tree data structure to construct the images needed to compute all the rays carrying fields above a preset threshold value no matter how many reflections are needed the paper briefly describes the input file required to define wall construction the floor plan the transmitter and the receiver locations a case study consisting of a long corridor with a small room on one side is used to demonstrate the features of the go 3d program building a better game through dynamic programming a flip analysis flip is a solitaire board game produced by craft woodworkers we analyze flip and suggest modifications to the rules to make the game more marketable in addition to being an interesting application of dynamic programming this case shows the use of operations research in managerial decision making designing and delivering a university course  a process or operations management perspective with over 30 years of academic experience in both engineering and management faculties involving trial and error experimentation in teaching as well as reading relevant literature and observing other instructors in action the author has accumulated a number of ideas regarding the preparation and delivery of a university course that should be of interest to other instructors this should be particularly the case for those individuals who have had little or no teaching experience eg those whose graduate education was recently completed at researchoriented institutions providing little guidance with respect to teaching a particular perspective is used to convey the ideas namely one of viewing the preparation and delivery of a course as two major processes that should provide outputs or outcomes that are of value to a number of customers in particular students a generalized pertcpm implementation in a spreadsheet this paper describes the implementation of the traditional pertcpm algorithm for finding the critical path in a project network in a spreadsheet the problem is of importance due to the recent shift of attention to using the spreadsheet environment as a vehicle for delivering management scienceoperations research msor techniques to endusers an objectoriented version of simlib a simple simulation package this paper introduces an objectoriented version of simlib an easytounderstand discreteevent simulation package the objectoriented version is preferable to the original procedural language versions of simlib in that it is easier to understand and teach simulation from an object point of view a singleserver queue simulation is demonstrated using the objectoriented simlib the maximum possible evpi in this paper we calculate the maximum expected value of perfect information evpi for any probability distribution for the states of the world this maximum evpi is an upper bound for the evpi with given probabilities and thus an upper bound for any partial information about the states of the world geotensity combining motion and lighting for 3d surface reconstruction this paper is about automatically reconstructing the full 3d surface of an object observed in motion by a single static camera based on the two paradigms structure from motion and linear intensity subspaces we introduce the geotensity constraint that governs the relationship between four or more images of a moving object we show that it is possible in theory to solve for 3d lambertian surface structure for the case of a single point light source and propose that a solution exists for an arbitrary number point light sources the surface may or may not be textured we then give an example of automatic surface reconstruction of a face under a point light source using arbitrary unknown object motion

popular television show who wants to be a millionaire this case discusses the monetary decisions contestants face on a game consisting of 15 increasingly difficult multiple choice questions since the game continues as long as a contestant answers correctly this case at its core is one of sequential decision analysis amenable to analysis via stochastic dynamic programming the case is also suitable for a course dealing with single decision analysis allowing for discussion of utility theory and bayesian probability revision in developing a story line for the case the author has sprinkled in much background material on probability and statistics this material is placed in a historical context illuminating some of the influential scholars involved in the development of these subjects as well as the birth of operations research and the management sciences blitzograms  interactive histograms as computers become ever faster more and more procedures that were once viewed as iterative will continue to become instantaneous the blitzogram is the application of this trend to histograms which the author hopes will lead to a better tacit understanding of probability distributions among both students and managers and this is not just an academic exercise commercial monte carlo simulation packages like risk and crystal ball and my insightxla are widely available teaching management science with spreadsheets from decision models to decision support the 1990s were a decade of enormous change for management science ms educators while the outlook at the beginning of the decade was somewhat bleak the renaissance in ms education brought about by the use of spreadsheets as the primary delivery vehicle for quantitative modeling techniques has resulted in a much brighter future this paper takes inventory of the current state of ms education and suggests some promising new directions in the area of decision support systems for ms educators to consider for the future teaching modeling in management science this essay discusses how we can most effectively teach management science to students in mba or similar programs who will be at best parttime practitioners of these arts i take as a working hypothesis the radical proposition that the heart of management science itself is not the impressive array of tools that have been built up over the years optimization simulation decision analysis queuing and so on but rather the art of reasoning logically with formal models i believe it is necessary with this group of students to teach basic modeling skills and in fact it is only when such students have these basic skills as a foundation that they are prepared to acquire the more sophisticated skills needed to employ management science in this paper i present a hierarchy of modeling skills from numeracy skills through sophisticated management science skills as a framework within which to plan courses for the occasional practitioner causes of the decline of the business school management science course the business school management science course is suffering serious decline the traditional model and algorithmbased course fails to meet the needs of mba programs and students poor student mathematical preparation is a reality and is not an acceptable justification for poor teaching outcomes management science phds are often poorly prepared to teach in a general management program having more experience and interest in algorithms than management the management science profession as a whole has focused its attention on algorithms and a narrow subset of management problems for which they are most applicable in contrast mbas rarely encounter problems that are suitable for straightforward application of management science tools living instead in a world where problems are illdefined data is scarce time is short politics is dominant and rational decision makers are nonexistent the root cause of the professions failure to address these issues seems to be in russell ackoffs words a habit of professional introversion that caused the profession to be uninterested in what mbas really do on the job and how management science can help them gifts to a science academic librarian gifts by their altruistic nature perfectly fit into the environment of universities and academic libraries as a universitys community and general public continue to donate materials libraries accept donations willingly both inkind and monetary eight steps of gift processing are listed in the paper positive and negative aspects of gift acceptance are discussed gifts bring value for academic libraries gifts can be considered additional routes to contribute to library collections without direct purchases options to add money to the library budget and the cement of social relationships but unfortunately large donations are timeconsuming laborintensive and costly to process great amounts of staff time and processing space are two main negative aspects that cause concern and put the value of gift acceptance under consideration by librarians some strategies in handling gifts are recommended to be effective academic science librarians need to approach gifts as an investment librarians are not to be forced by moral and public notions and should be able to make professional decisions in evaluating proposed collections four factors influencing the

article provides detailed advice on acquiring new outofprint and rare materials in the history of science technology and medicine for the beginner in these fields the focus is on the policy formation basic reference tools and methods of collection development and acquisitions that are the necessary basis for success in this endeavor information architecture looking ahead it may be a bit strange to consider where the field of information architecture ia is headed after all many would argue that its too new to be considered as a field at all or that it is mislabeled and by no means is there a widely accepted definition of what information architecture actually is practicing information architects probably number in the thousands and this vibrant group is already building various forms of communal infrastructure ranging from an ia journal and a selforganizing library of resources to a passel of local professional groups and degreegranting academic programs so the profession has achieved a beachhead that will enable it to stabilize and perhaps even grow during these difficult times decisions decisions decisions a tale of special collections in the small academic library a case study of a special collections department in a small academic library and how its collections have been acquired and developed over the years is described it looks at the changes that have occurred in the academic environment and what effect if any these changes may have had on the department and how it has adapted to them it raises questions about development and acquisitions policies and procedures acquisitions in the james ford bell library this article presents basic acquisitions philosophy and approaches in a noted special collection with commentary on just saying no and on how the electronic revolution has changed the acquisition of special collections materials underground poetry collecting poetry and the librarian a powerful encounter with underground poetry and its important role in poetry literature and culture is discussed the acquisitions difficulties encountered in the unique publishing world of underground poetry are introduced strategies for acquiring underground poetry for library collections are proposed including total immersion and local focus with accompanying action on emotion and bounded rationality reply to hanoch the author refers to the comment made by hanoch see ibid vol49 2000 on his model of bounded rationality and the role of the yerkesdodson law and emotional arousal in it the author points out that hanochs comment however conspicuously fails to challenge  much less contradict  the central hypothesis of his paper in addition several of hanochs criticisms are based on a wrong characterization of the positions the effects of emotions on bounded rationality a comment on kaufman bruce kaufmans article 1999 emotional arousal as a source of bounded rationality objective is to present an additional source of bounded rationality one that is not due to cognitive constraints but to high emotional arousal in doing so kaufman is following a long tradition of thinkers who have contrasted emotion with reason claiming for the most part that emotions are a violent force hindering rational thinking this paper aims to challenge kaufmans unidimensional idea regarding the connection between high emotional arousal and decision making emotion and selfcontrol a biologybased model of choice is used to examine timeinconsistent preferences and the problem of selfcontrol emotion is shown to be the biological substrate of choice in that emotional systems assign value to goods in the environment and also facilitate the learning of expectations regarding alternative options for acquiring those goods a third major function of the emotional choice systems is motivation selfcontrol is shown to be the result of a problem with the inhibition of the motive force of emotion where this inhibition is necessary for higher level deliberation product and process innovations in the life cycle of an industry filson 2001 uses industrylevel data on firm numbers price quantity and quality along with an equilibrium model of industry evolution to estimate the nature and effects of quality and cost improvements in the personal computer industry and four other new industries this paper studies the personal computer industry in more detail and shows that the model explains some peculiar patterns that cannot be explained by previous lifecycle models the model estimates are evaluated using historical studies of the evolution of the personal computer industry and patterns that require further model development are described a comparison of the discounted utility model and hyperbolic discounting models in the case of social and private intertemporal preferences for health whilst there is substantial evidence that hyperbolic discounting models describe intertemporal preferences for monetary outcomes better than the discounted utility du model there is only very limited evidence in the context of health outcomes this study elicits private and social intertemporal preferences for nonfatal changes in health specific functional forms of the du model and three hyperbolic models are fitted the results show that the stationarity axiom is violated and that the hyperbolic models fit the data better than the du model intertemporal preferences for private and social decisions are found to be very similar modeling the labor market as an evolving institution model artemis a stylized french labor market is modeled as an endogenously evolving institution boundedly rational firms and individuals strive to decrease the cost or increase utility the labor market is coordinated by a search process and decentralized setting of hiring standards but intermediaries can speed up matching the model reproduces the dynamics of the gross flows and spectacular changes in mobility patterns of some demographic groups when the oil crisis in the 1970s occurred notably the sudden decline of the integration in good jobs the internal labor markets of large firms are shown to increase unemployment if the secondary temporary or bad jobs do not exist the ultimate control group empirical research on the organization of firms requires that firms be classified on the basis of their control structures this should be done in a way that can potentially be made operational it is easy to identify the ultimate controller of a hierarchical organization and the literature has largely focused on this case however many organizational structures mix hierarchy with collective choice procedures such as voting or use circular structures under which superiors are accountable to their subordinates the author develops some analytic machinery that can be used to map the authority structures of such organizations and show that under mild restrictions there is a welldefined ultimate control group the results are consistent with intuitions about the nature of control in familiar economic settings information architecture for bilingual web sites creating an information architecture for a bilingual web site presents particular challenges beyond those that exist for single and multilanguage sites this article reports work in progress on the development of a contentbased bilingual web site to facilitate the sharing of resources and information between speech and language therapists the development of the information architecture is based on a combination of two aspects an abstract structural analysis of existing bilingual web designs focusing on the presentation of bilingual material and a bilingual cardsorting activity conducted with potential users issues for bilingual developments are discussed and some observations are made regarding the use of cardsorting activities modularity in technology and organization the paper is an attempt to raid both the literature on modular design and the literature on property rights to create the outlines of a modularity theory of the firm such a theory will look at firms and other organizations in terms of the partitioning of rightsunderstood as protected spheres of authorityamong cooperating parties it will assert that organizations reflect nonmodular structures that is structures in which decision rights rights of alienation and residual claims to income do not all reside in the same hands designing a new urban internet the parallel between designing a web site and the construction of a building is a familiar one but how often do we think of the internet as having parks and streets it would be absurd to say that the internet could ever take the place of real livable communities however it is safe to say that the context for using the internet is on a path of change as the internet evolves beyond a simple linkage of disparate web sites and applications the challenge for information architects is establishing a process by which to structure organize and design networked environments the principles that guide new urbanism can offer much insight into networked electronic environment design at the core of every new urbanism principle is the idea of wholenessof making sure that neighborhoods and communities are knit together in a way that supports civic activities economic development efficient ecosystems aesthetic beauty and human interaction threedimensional optimum design of the cooling lines of injection moulds based on boundary element design sensitivity analysis a threedimensional numerical simulation using the boundary element method is proposed which can predict the cavity temperature distributions in the cooling stage of injection moulding then choosing the radii and positions of cooling lines as design variables the boundary integral sensitivity formulations are deduced for the optimum design of cooling lines the squared difference between the objective temperature and temperature of the cavity is taken as the objective function based on the optimization techniques with design sensitivity analysis an iterative algorithm to reach the minimum value of the objective function is introduced which leads to the optimum design of cooling lines at the same time managing safety and strategic stocks to improve materials requirements planning performance this paper provides a methodology for managing safety and strategic stocks in materials requirements planning mrp environments to face uncertainty in market demand a set of recommended guidelines suggest where to position how to dimension and when to replenish both safety and strategic stocks tradeoffs between stock positioning and dimensioning and between stock positioning and replenishment order triggering are outlined the study reveals also that most of the decisions are system specific so that they should be evaluated in a quantitative manner through simulation a case study is reported where the benefits from adopting the new proposed methodology lie in achieving the target service level even under peak demand conditions with the value of safety stocks as a whole growing only by about 20 per cent innovative manufacture of impulse

dispatching rules with finite buffer capacity in addition the effect of changing part mix ratios is also discussed the performance measures considered are makespan average machine utilization average flow time and average delay at local input buffers simulation results indicate that the alternative routings dynamic policy gives the best results in three performance measures except for average delay at local input buffers further the effect of changing part mix ratios is not significant an intelligent fuzzy decision system for a flexible manufacturing system with multidecision points this paper describes an intelligent fuzzy decision support system for realtime scheduling and dispatching of parts in a flexible manufacturing system fms with alternative routing possibilities for all parts a fuzzy logic approach is developed to improve the system performance by considering multiple performance measures and at multiple decision points the characteristics of the system status instead of parts are fed back to assign priority to the parts waiting to be processed a simulation model is developed and it is shown that the proposed intelligent fuzzy decision support system keeps all performance measures at a good level the proposed intelligent system is a promising tool for dealing with scheduling fmss in contrast to traditional rules a design to cost system for innovative

aided design cad solid modelling system a material selection module a knowledgebased system kbs a process optimization module a design for assembly module a cost estimation module and a user interface two manufacturing processes namely machining and injection moulding processes were considered in the developed system the main function of the system besides estimating the product cost is to generate

is modelled using fractals and a dimension is computed for its description the variation in the fractal dimension with the cutting speed is explored layerbased machining recent development and support structure design there is growing interest in additive and subtractive shaping theories that are synthesized to integrate the layered manufacturing process and material removal process layerbased machining has emerged as a promising method for integrated additive and subtractive shaping theory in the paper major layerbased machining systems are reviewed and compared according to characteristics of stock layers numerical control machining configurations stacking operations input format and raw materials support structure a major issue in machiningbased systems which has seldom been addressed in previous research is investigated in the paper with considerations of four situations floating overhang cantilever vaulted overhang and ceiling except for the floating overhang where a support structure should not be overlooked the necessity for support structures for the other three situations is determined by stress and deflection analysis this is demonstrated by the machining of a large castle model worlds biggest battery helps to stabilise alaska in this paper the author describes a battery energy storage system which is under construction to provide voltage compensation in support of alaskas 138 kv northern intertie information interaction providing a framework for information architecture information interaction is the process that people use in interacting with the content of an information system information architecture is a blueprint and navigational aid to the content of informationrich systems as such information architecture performs an important supporting role in information interactivity this article elaborates on a model of information interactivity that crosses the nomans land between user and computer articulating a model that includes user content and system illustrating the context for information architecture alloptical logic nor gate using twocascaded semiconductor optical amplifiers the authors present a novel alloptical logic nor gate using twocascaded semiconductor optical amplifiers soas in a counterpropagating feedback configuration this configuration accentuates the gain nonlinearity due to the mutual gain modulation of the two soas the alloptical nor gate feasibility has been demonstrated delivering an extinction ratio higher than 12 db over a wide range of wavelength prospects for quantitative computed tomography imaging in the presence of foreign metal bodies using statistical image reconstruction xray computed tomography ct images of patients bearing metal intracavitary applicators or other metal foreign objects exhibit severe artifacts including streaks and aliasing we have systematically evaluated via computer simulations the impact of scattered radiation the polyenergetic spectrum and measurement noise on the performance of three reconstruction algorithms conventional filtered backprojection fbp deterministic iterative deblurring and a new iterative algorithm alternating minimization am based on a ct detector model that includes noise scatter and polyenergetic spectra contrary to the dominant view of the literature fbp streaking artifacts are due mostly to mismatches between fbps simplified model of ct detector response and the physical process of signal acquisition artifacts on am images are significantly mitigated as this algorithm substantially reduces detectormodel mismatches however metal artifacts are reduced to acceptable levels only when prior knowledge of the metal object in the patient including its pose shape and attenuation map are used to constrain ams iterations am image reconstruction in combination with objectconstrained ct to estimate the pose of metal objects in the patient is a promising approach for effectively mitigating metal artifacts and making quantitative estimation of tissue attenuation coefficients a clinical possibility matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck area development of method and validation positron emission tomography pet provides important information on tumor biology but lacks detailed anatomical information our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck three difficulties in achieving this goal are 1 nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations 2 emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods and 3 no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results these problems are solved as follows accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask the proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan to obtain sufficient anatomical information for matching two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol a mutual informationbased algorithm was used as a registration technique pet and ct data were obtained in seven patients each patient had two ct scans and one pet scan the datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching pet to ctsub 1 ctsub 1 to ctsub 2 and ctsub 2 to pet using the full circle consistency test it was found that using our method consistency could be obtained of 4 mm and 13 degrees on average the pet voxels used for registration were 515 mm so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size cropping the images removing the scanner bed from images did not improve the consistency of the algorithm the transmission scan however could potentially be reduced to a single position using this approach in conclusion the represented algorithm and validation technique has several features that are attractive from both theoretical and practical point of view it is a userindependent automatic validation technique for matching ct and pet scans of the head and neck which gives the opportunity to compare different image enhancements fresh tracks food processing bar code labels and wireless terminals linked to a centralized database accurately track meat products from receiving to customers for farmland foods statistical inference with partial prior information based on a gausstype inequality potter and anderson 1983 have developed a bayesian decision procedure requiring the specification of a class of prior distributions restricted to have a minimal probability content for a given subset of the parameter space they do not however provide a method for the selection of that subset we show how a generalization of gauss inequality can be used to determine the relevant parameter subset global stability of the attracting set of an enzymecatalysed reaction system the essential feature of enzymatic reactions is a nonlinear dependency of reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation kinetics recently it has been shown that this feature is associated with the phenomenon of loss of system coordination liu 1999 in this paper we study a system of ordinary differential equations representing a branched biochemical system of enzymemediated reactions we show that this system can become very sensitive to changes in certain maximum enzyme activities in particular we show that the system exhibits three distinct responses a unique globallystable steadystate large amplitude oscillations and asymptotically unbounded solutions with the transition between these states being almost instantaneous it is shown that the appearance of large amplitude stable limit cycles occurs due to a false bifurcation or canard explosion the subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow namely a saddle connection subsequently almost all nonnegative data become unbounded under the action of the dynamical system and correspond exactly to loss of system coordination we discuss the relevance of these results to the possible consequences of modulating such systems a spatial rainfall simulator for crop production modeling in southern africa this paper describes a methodology for simulating rainfall in dekads across a set of spatial units in areas where longterm meteorological records are available for a small number of sites only the work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of zimbabwe which includes a crop production component for yields of maize small grains and groundnuts only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intraseasonal temporal correlation was negligible but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations this spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of 30 related variables representing dekadly rainfall in each of the 30 wards for each ward logtransformed rainfall for each of the 36 dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations a covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given dekad crossvalidation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well the methodology developed is useful in situations where longterm climatic records are scarce and where rainfall shows pronounced spatial correlation but negligible temporal correlation an algorithm to generate all spanning trees with flow spanning tree enumeration in undirected graphs is an important issue and task in many problems encountered in computer network and circuit analysis this paper discusses the spanning tree with flow for the case that there are flow requirements between each node pair an algorithm based on minimal paths mps is proposed to generate all spanning trees without flow the proposed algorithm is a structured approach which splits the system into structural mps first and also all steps in it are easy to follow nonlinear systems arising from nonisothermal nonnewtonian heleshaw flows in the presence of body forces and sources in this paper we first give a formal derivation of several systems of equations for injection moulding this is done starting from the basic equations for nonisothermal nonnewtonian flows in a threedimensional domain we derive systems for both tsup 0 psup 0 and tsup 1 psup 1 in the presence of body forces and sources we find that body forces and sources have a nonlinear effect on the systems we also derive a nonlinear darcy law our formulation includes not only the pressure gradient but also body forces and sources which play the role of a nonlinearity later we prove the existence of weak solutions to certain boundary value problems and initialboundary value problems associated with the resulting equations for tsup 0 psup 0 but in a more general mathematical setting analyzing the potential of a firm an operations research approach an approach to analyzing the potential of a firm which is understood as the firms ability to provide goods or and services to be supplied to a marketplace under restrictions imposed by a business environment in which the firm functions is proposed the approach is based on using linear inequalities and generally mixed variables in modelling this ability for a broad spectrum of industrial transportation agricultural and other types of firms and allows one to formulate problems of analyzing the potential of a firm as linear programming problems or mixed programming problems with linear constraints this approach generalizes a previous one which was proposed for a more narrow class of models and allows one to effectively employ a widely available software for solving practical problems of the considered kind especially for firms described by large scale models of mathematical programming discrete output feedback sliding mode control of second order systems  a moving switching line approach the sliding mode control systems smcs for which the switching variable is designed independent of the initial conditions are known to be sensitive to parameter variations and extraneous disturbances during the reaching phase for second order systems this drawback is eliminated by using the moving switching line technique where the switching line is initially designed to pass the initial conditions and is subsequently moved towards a predetermined switching line in this paper we make use of the above idea of moving switching line together with the reaching law approach to design a discrete output feedback sliding mode control the main contributions of this work are such that we do not require to use system states as it makes use of only the output samples for designing the controller and by using the moving switching line a low sensitivity system is obtained through shortening the reaching phase simulation results show that the fast output sampling feedback guarantees sliding motion similar to that obtained using state feedback when a better interface and easy navigation arent enough examining the information architecture in a law enforcement agency an information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly usable system but usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation in this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency one system is a legacy textbased system with cumbersome navigation rms the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation copnet it is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate copnet higher than rms but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will we conducted two user studies one study examined what users thought of rms and copnet and compared rms experts evaluations with nonexperts we found that all users evaluated copnet as more effective easier to use and easier to navigate than rms and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system the second followup study examined use behavior after copnet was deployed some time later the findings revealed that evaluations of copnet were not associated with its use if the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older legacy system why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch we discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult especially for those who are most adept at using the older system implications for system design and usability are also discussed optimization of planning an advertising campaign of goods and services a generalization of the mathematical model and operations research problems formulated on its basis which were presented by belenky 2001 in the framework of an approach to planning an advertising campaign of goods and services is considered and corresponding nonlinear programming problems with linear constraints are formulated alloptical xor gate using semiconductor optical amplifiers without additional input beam the novel design of an alloptical xor gate by using crossgain modulation of semiconductor optical amplifiers has been suggested and demonstrated successfully at 10 gbs boolean ab and ab of the two input signals a and b have been obtained and combined to achieve the alloptical xor gate no additional input beam such as a clock signal or continuous wave light is used in this new design which is required in other alloptical xor gates trust in online advice many people are now influenced by the information and advice they find on the internet much of it of dubious quality this article describes two studies concerned with those factors capable of influencing peoples response to online advice the first study is a qualitative account of a group of househunters attempting to find worthwhile information online the second study describes a survey of more than 2500 people who had actively sought advice over the internet a framework for understanding trust in online advice is proposed in which first impressions are distinguished from more detailed evaluations good web design can influence the first process but three key factorssource credibility personalization and predictabilityare shown to predict whether people actually follow the advice given the social impact of internet gambling technology has always played a role in the development of gambling practices and continues to provide new market opportunities one of the fastest growing areas is that of internet gambling the effect of such technologies should not be accepted uncritically particularly as there may be areas of potential concern based on what is known about problem gambling offline this article has three aims first it overviews some of the main social concerns about the rise of internet gambling second it looks at the limited research that has been carried out in this area third it examines whether internet gambling is doubly addictive given research that suggests that the internet can be addictive itself it is concluded that technological developments in internet gambling will increase the potential for problem gambling globally but that many of the ideas and speculations outlined in this article need to be addressed further by largescale empirical studies computermediated communication and remote management integration or isolation the use of intranets and emails to communicate with remote staff is increasing rapidly within organizations for many companies this is viewed as a speedy and costeffective way of keeping in contact with staff and ensuring their continuing commitment to company goals this article highlights the problems experienced by staff when managers use intranets and emails in an inappropriate fashion for these purposes issues of remoteness and isolation are discussed along with the reports of frustration and disidentification experienced however it will be shown that when used appropriately communication using these technologies can facilitate shared understanding and help remote staff to view their company as alive and exciting theoretical aspects are highlighted and the implications of these findings are discussed collective action in the age of the internet mass communication and online mobilization this article examines how the internet transforms collective action current practices on the web bear witness to thriving collective action ranging from persuasive to confrontational individual to collective undertakings even more influential than direct calls for action is the indirect mobilizing influence of the internets powers of mass communication which is boosted by an antiauthoritarian ideology on the web theoretically collective action through the otherwise socially isolating computer is possible because people rely on internalized group memberships and social identities to achieve social involvement empirical evidence from an online survey among environmental activists and nonactivists confirms that online action is considered an equivalent alternative to offline action by activists and nonactivists alike however the internet may slightly alter the motives underlying collective action and thereby alter the nature of collective action and social movements perhaps more fundamental is the reverse influence that successful collective action will have on the nature and function of the internet explanations for the perpetration of and reactions to deception in a virtual community cases of identity deception on the internet are not uncommon several cases of a revealed identity deception have been reported in the media the authors examine a case of deception in an online community composed primarily of information technology professionals in this case an established community member df invented a character nowheremom whom he fell in love with and who was eventually killed in a tragic accident when other members of the community eventually began to question nowheremoms actual identity df admitted that he invented her the discussion board was flooded with reactions to dfs revelation the authors propose several explanations for the perpetration of identity deception including psychiatric illness identity play and expressions of true self they also analyze the reactions of community members and propose three related explanations social identity deviance and norm violation to account for their reactions it is argued that virtual communities reactions to such threatening events provide invaluable clues for the study of group processes on the internet the effects of asynchronous computermediated group interaction on group processes this article reports a study undertaken to investigate some of the social psychological processes underlying computersupported group discussion in natural computermediated contexts based on the concept of deindividuation it was hypothesized that personal identifiability and group identity would be important factors that affect the perceptions and behavior of members of computermediated groups the degree of personal identifiability and the strength of group identity were manipulated across groups of geographically dispersed computer users who took part in email discussions during a 2week period the results do not support the association between deindividuation and uninhibited behavior cited in much previous research instead the data provide some support for a social identity perspective of computermediated communication which explains the higher levels uninhibited in identifiable computermediated groups however predictions based on social identity theory regarding group polarization and group cohesion were not supported possible explanations for this are discussed and further research is suggested to resolve these discrepancies online longitudinal survey research viability and participation this article explores the viability of conducting longitudinal survey research using the internet in samples exposed to trauma a questionnaire battery assessing psychological adjustment following adverse life experiences was posted online participants who signed up to take part in the longitudinal aspect of the study were contacted 3 and 6 months after initial participation to complete the second and third waves of the research issues of data screening and sample attrition rates are considered and the demographic profiles and questionnaire scores of those who did and did not take part in the study during successive time points are compared the results demonstrate that it is possible to conduct repeated measures survey research online and that the similarity in characteristics between those who do and do not take part during successive time points mirrors that found in traditional pencilandpaper trauma surveys internetbased psychological experimenting five dos and five donts internetbased psychological experimenting is presented as a method that needs careful consideration of a number of issuesfrom potential data corruption to revealing confidential information about participants ten issues are grouped into five areas of actions to be taken when developing an internet experiment dos and five errors to be avoided donts dos include a utilizing dropout as a dependent variable b the use of dropout to detect motivational confounding c placement of questions for personal information d using a collection of techniques and e using internetbased tools donts are about a unprotected directories b public access

enterprise the paperless office is an idea whose time has come and come and come again to see how pervasive computing applications might bring some substance to this dream the author spoke recently with key managers and technologists at mckesson corporation san francisco a healthcare supplier service and technology company with us50 billion in sales last year and also at avantgo hayward calif a provider of mobile infrastructure software and services for the past several years mckesson has used mobility middleware developed by avantgo to deploy major supply chain applications with thousands of pervasive clients and multiple servers that replace existing paperbased tracking systems according to mckessons managers their system greatly reduced errors and associated costs caused by redelivery or loss of valuable products giving mckesson a solid return on its investment psychology and the internet this article presents an overview of the way that the internet is being used to assist psychological research and mediate psychological practice it shows how psychologists are using the internet to examine the interactions between people and computers and highlights some of the ways that this research is important to the design and development of useable and acceptable computer systems in particular this introduction reviews the research presented at the international conference on psychology and the internet held in the united kingdom the final part introduces the eight articles in this special edition the articles are representative of the breadth of research being conducted on psychology and the internet there are two on methodological issues three on group processes one on organizational implications and two on social implications of internet use extended depthoffocus imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence from intact leaves imaging dynamic changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence provides a valuable means with which to examine localised changes in photosynthetic function microscopebased systems provide excellent spatial resolution which allows the response of individual cells to be measured however such systems have a restricted depth of focus and as leaves are inherently uneven only a small proportion of each image at any given focal plane is in focus in this report we describe the development of algorithms specifically adapted for imaging chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic function in living plant cells which allow extendedfocus images to be reconstructed from images taken in different focal planes we describe how these procedures can be used to reconstruct images of chlorophyll fluorescence and calculated photosynthetic parameters as well as producing a map of leaf topology the robustness of this procedure is demonstrated using leaves from a number of different plant species allan variance and fractal brownian motion noise filtering is the subject of a voluminous literature in radio engineering the methods of filtering require knowledge of the frequency response which is usually unknown dw allan see proc ieee vol54 no2 p22130 1966 ieee trans instr measur volim36 p64654 1987 proposed a simple method of determining the interval between equally accurate observations which does without this information in this method the variances of the increments of noise and signal are equal so that in observations with a greater step the variations caused by noise are smaller than those caused by the signal this method is the standard accepted by the usa metrology community the present paper is devoted to a statistical analysis of the allan method and acquisition of additional information ideal sliding mode in the problems of convex optimization the characteristics of the sliding mode that appears with using continuous convexprogramming algorithms based on the exact penalty functions were discussed for the case under study the ideal sliding mode was shown to occur in the absence of infinite number

programs on the basis of a vector criterion the method is urgent for the effective use of resources of computational clusters and metacomputational media and also for dynamic control of processes in real time on the basis of the static scaling the pp rearrangement and failuretolerance of double pary multirings and generalized hypercubes it is shown that an arbitrary grouped pelement permutation can be implemented in a conflictfree way through the commutation of channels on the double pary multiring or the double pary hypercube it is revealed that in arbitrary singleelement permutations these commutators display the property of the p1nodal failuretolerance and the generalized hypercube displays in addition the property of the p1channel failuretolerance solutions for cooperative games a new

stepwise optimization algorithm for a network with given adjacency matrix based on an algorithm for constructing minimalcost routes is designed knowledge managementcapturing the skills of key performers in the power industry the growing pressure to reduce the cost of electrical power in recent years has resulted in an enormous braindrain within the power industry a novel approach has been developed by eskom to capture these skills before they are lost and to incorporate these into a computerbased programme called knowledge management control in active systems based on criteria and motivation for active systems where the principal varies the agents goal functions by adding to them appropriately weighted goal functions of other agents or a balanced system of interagent transfers the paper formulated and solved the problems of control based on criteria and motivation linear active systems were considered by way of example flexibility analysis of complex technical systems under uncertainty an important problem in designing technical systems under partial uncertainty of the initial physical chemical and technological data is the determination of a design in which the technical system is flexible ie its control system is capable of guaranteeing that the constraints hold even under changes in external and internal factors and application of fuzzy mathematical models in its design three flexibility problems viz the flexibility of a technical system of given structure structural flexibility of a technical system and the optimal design guaranteeing the flexibility

theorem are given stochastic systems with a random jump in phase trajectory stability of their motions the probabilistic stability of the perturbed motion of a system with parameters under the action of a general markov process is studied the phase vector is assumed to experience random jumps when the structure the system suffers random jumps such a situation is encountered for example in the motion of a solid with random jumps in its mass the meansquare stability of randomstructure linear systems and stability of nonlinear systems in the first approximation are studied the applied approach is helpful in studying the asymptotic probabilistic stability and meansquare exponential stability of stochastic systems through the stability of the respective deterministic systems a nonlinear timeoptimal control problem sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal control in a timeoptimal control problem with fixed ends for a smooth nonlinear control system are formulated the properties of this system for characterizing the optimal control switching points are studied system embedding polynomial equations the class of solutions of the polynomial equations including their generalizations in the form of the bezout matrix identities was constructed analytically using the technology of constructive system embedding the structure of a solution depends on the number of steps of the euclidean algorithm and is obtained explicitly by appropriate substitutions illustrative and descriptive examples are presented an optimal control algorithm based on reachability set approximation and linearization the terminal functional of a general control system is refined by studying an analogous problem for a variational system and regularization a sequential refinement method is designed by combining the local approximation of the reachability set and reduction the corresponding algorithm has relaxation properties an illustrative example is given a universal decomposition of the integration range for exponential functions the problem of determining the independent constants for decomposition of the integration range of exponential functions was solved on the basis of a similar approach to polynomials the constants obtained enable one to decompose the integration range in two so that the integrals over them are equal independently of the function parameters for the nontrigonometrical polynomials of even functions an alternative approach was presented an application of fuzzy linear regression to the information

linear models of circuits based on the multivalued components linearization and planarization of the circuit models is pivotal to the submicron technologies on the other hand the characteristics of the vlsi circuits can be sometimes improved by using the multivalued components it was shown that any llevel circuit based on the multivalued components is representable as an algebraic model based on l linear arithmetic polynomials mapped correspondingly into l decision diagrams that are linear and planar by nature complexity of representing a circuit as the linear decision diagram was estimated as og with g for the number of multivalued components in the circuit the results of testing the lineardesignmv algorithm on circuits of more than 8000 lgsynth 93 multivalued components were presented a new approach to the problem of structural identification ii the subject under discussion is a new approach to the problem of structural identification which relies on the recognition of a decisive

computing market the discussion combines historical analysis with strategic analysis to provide a framework to analyse a key component of the computer industry this analysis begins from the perspective of government research and development spending then examines the confusion around the evolution of the highend computing market in the context of standard theories of technology strategy and new product innovation rather than the highend market being dead one should view the market as changing due to increased capability and competition from the lowend personal computer market the highend market is also responding to new product innovation from the introduction of new parallel computing architectures in the conclusion key leverage points in the market are identified and the trends in highend computing are highlighted with implications strong active solution in noncooperative games for the noncooperative games and the problems of accepting or rejecting a proposal a new notion of equilibrium was proposed its place among the known basic equilibria was established and its application to the static and dynamic game problems was demonstrated system embedding control with reduced observer two interrelated problemsdesign of the reduced observer of plant state separately and together with its control systemwere considered from the standpoint of designing the multivariable linear systems from the desired matrix transfer functions the matrix equations defining the entire constructive class of solutions of the posed problems were obtained using the system embedding technology as was demonstrated control based on the reduced observer is capable to provide the desired response to the control input as well as the response to the nonzero initial conditions only for the directly measurable part of the components of the state vector an illustrative example was presented spectral characteristics of the linear systems over a bounded time interval consideration was given to the spectral characteristics of the linear dynamic systems over a bounded time interval singular characteristics of standard dynamic blocks transcendental characteristic equations and partial spectra of the singular functions were studied relationship between the spectra under study and the classical frequency characteristic was demonstrated quantum computing with solids science and technology could be revolutionized by quantum computers but building them from solidstate devices will not be easy the author outlines the challenges in scaling up the technology from lab experiments to practical devices the perils of privacy the recent string of failures among dotcom companies has heightened fears of privacy abuse what should happen to the names and addresses on a customer list if these details were obtained under a privacy policy which specified no disclosure to any third party should the personal data in the list be deemed to be an asset of a failing company which can be transferred to any future third party purchaser for its purposes or should the privacy policy take precedence over the commercial concerns of the purchaser enterprise in focus at netsec 2002 netsec 2002 took place in san francisco amid industry reflection on the balance to be struck between combatting cyberterrorism and safeguarding civil liberties post911 the author reports on the punditry and the pedagogy at the csi event focusing on security in the enterprise trustedortrustworthy the search for a new paradigm for computer and network security this paper sets out a number of major questions and challenges which include a just what is meant by trusted or trustworthy systems after 20 years of experience or more likely lack of business level experience with the trusted computer system criteria anyway b does anyone really care about the adoption of international standards for computer system security evaluation by it product and system manufacturers and suppliers is 15408 and if so how does it all relate to business risk management anyway is 17799 c with the explosion of adoption of the microcomputer and personal computer some 20 years ago has the industry abandoned all that it learnt about security during the mainframe era or  whatever happened to multics and its lessons d has education kept up with security requirements by industry and government alike in the need for safe and secure operation of large scale and networked information systems on national and international bases particularly where web or internetbased information services are being proposed as the major next best thing in the it industry e has the fourth generation of computer professionals inherited the spirit of information systems management and control that resided by necessity with the last generation the professionals who developed and created the applications for shared mainframe and minicomputer systems much ado about nothing win32perrun jpeg files do not contain any executable code and it is impossible to infect such files the author takes a look at the details surrounding the win32perrun virus and make clear exactly what it does the main virus feature is its ability to affect jpeg image files compressed graphic images and to spread via affected jpeg files the virus affects or modifies or alters jpeg files but does not infect them information security policy  what do international information security standards say one of the most important information security controls is the information security policy this vital directiongiving document is however not always easy to develop and the authors thereof battle with questions such as what constitutes a policy this results in the policy authors turning to existing sources for guidance one of these sources is the various international information security standards these standards are a good starting point for determining what the information security policy should consist of but should not be relied upon exclusively for guidance firstly they are not comprehensive in their coverage and furthermore tending to rather address the processes needed for successfully implementing the information security policy it is far more important the information security policy must fit in with the organisations culture and must therefore be developed with this in mind security crisis management  the basics of the more pervasive problems in any kind of security event is how the security event is managed from the inception to the end theres a lot written about how to manage a specific incident or how to deal with a point problem such as a firewall log but little tends to be written about how to deal with the management of a security event as part of corporate crisis management this article discusses the basics of security crisis management and of the logical steps required to ensure that a security crisis does not get out of hand a conceptual framework for evaluation of information technology investments the decision to acquire a new information technology poses a number of serious evaluation and selection problems to technology managers because the new system must not only meet current information requirements of the organisation but also the needs for future expansion tangible and intangible benefits factors as well as risks factors must be identified and evaluated the paper provides a review of ten major evaluation categories and available models which fall under each category showing their advantages and disadvantages in handling the above difficulties this paper describes strategic implications involved in the selection decision and the inherent difficulties in 1 choosing or developing a model 2 obtaining realistic inputs for the model and 3 making tradeoffs among the conflicting factors it proposes a conceptual framework to help the decision maker in choosing the most appropriate methodology in the evaluation process it also offers a new model called gahp for the evaluation problem combining integer goal linear programming and analytic hierarchy process ahp in a single hybrid multiple objective multicriteria model a goal programming methodology with zeroone integer variables and mixed integer constraints is used to set goal target values against which information technology alternatives are evaluated and selected ahp is used to structure the evaluation process providing pairwise comparison mechanisms to quantify subjective nonmonetary intangible benefits and risks factors in deriving data for the model a case illustration is provided showing how gahp can be formulated and solved data storage reformat closely tracking a fastmoving sector in the past few years the data center market has changed dramatically forcing many companies into consolidation or bankruptcy gone are the days when companies raised millions of dollars to acquire large industrial buildings and transform them into glittering hightech palaces filled with the latest telecommunication and data technology whereas manufacturers of communication technology deliver the racked equipment in these often missioncritical facilities abb focuses mainly on the building infrastructure besides the very important redundant power supply abb also provides the redundant air conditioning and the security system industrialsup it for performance buildings abb has taken a close look at how buildings are used and has come up with a radical solution for the technical infrastructure that places the endusers processes at the center and integrates all the buildings systems around their needs the new solution is based on the realization that tasks like setting up an office meeting registering a hotel guest or moving a patient in a hospital can all benefit from the same industrial it concepts employed by abb to optimize manufacturing for example in the automotive industry virtual engineering office a stateoftheart platform for engineering collaboration a sales force in latin america the design department in europe and production in asia arrangements of this kind are the new business reality for todays global manufacturing companies but how are such global operations to be effectively coordinated abbs answer was to develop and implement a new platform for highperformance realtime collaboration globally distributed engineering teams can now work together regardless of time location or the cad system they use making abb easier to do business with for customers as well as

solutions for car windshield assembly just looking through a cars windshield doesnt give us much reason to wonder about how its made the idea that special manufacturing expertise might be required can hardly occur to anyone but thats exactly what is needed to ensure crystalclear visibility not to mention a perfect fit every time one is pressed into place on a car production line comprising two thin glass sheets joined by a vinyl interlayer windshields are assembledusually manuallyto very precise product and environmental specifications to make sure this is done as perfectly as possible the industry invests heavily in the equipment used for their fabrication abb has now developed a robotbased compact assembling system for the automatic assembly of laminated windshields that speeds up production and increases cost efficiency shaping the future bendwizard a tool for offline programming of robotic tending systems setting up a robot to make metal cabinets or cases for desktop computers can be a complex operation for instance one expert might be required to carry out a feasibility study and then another to actually program the robot understandably the need for so much expertise and the time thats required generally limits the usefulness of automation to highvolume production workshops producing parts in batches smaller than 50 or so or which rely heavily on semiskilled operators are therefore often discouraged from investing in automation and so miss out on its many advantages what is needed is a software tool that operators without special knowledge of robotics or with no more than rudimentary cad skills can use one which allows easy offline programming and simulation of the work cell on a pc press shop industrial it solutions for the press shop globalization of the worlds markets is challenging the traditional limits of manufacturing efficiency the competitive advantage belongs to those who understand the new requirements and opportunities and who commit to integrated solutions that span the value chain all the way from demand to production abbs automation and it expertise and the process knowhow gained from its long involvement with the automotive industry have been brought together in new stateoftheart software solutions for press shops integrated into industrial it architecture they allow the full potential of the shops to be realized with advantages at every step in the supply chain realtime enterprise solutions for discrete manufacturing and consumer goods customer satisfaction and a focus on core competencies have dominated the thinking of a whole host of industries in recent years however one outcome the outsourcing of noncore activities has made the production of goodsfrom order entry to final deliverymore and more complex suppliers subsuppliers producers and customers are therefore busy adopting a new more collaborative approach this is mainly taking the form of orderdriven planning and scheduling of production but it is also being steered by a need to reduce inventories and working capital as well as a desire to increase throughput and optimize production extinction cross sections of realistic raindrops databank established using tmatrix method and nonlinear fitting technique a new computer program is developed based on the tmatrix method to generate a large number of total extinction cross sections tcs values of the realistic raindrops that are deformed due to a balance of the forces that act on a drop failing under gravity and were described in shape by pruppacher and pitter 1971 these data for various dimensions of the raindrops mean effective radius from 0 to 325 mm frequencies 10 to 80 ghz horizontal and vertical polarizations and temperatures 0 10 and 20 degrees c are stored to establish a data bank furthermore a curve fitting technique ie interpolation of order 3 is implemented for the tcs values in the data bank therefore the interpolated tcs results can be obtained readily from the interpolation process with negligible or even null computational time and efforts error analysis is carried out to show the high accuracy of the present analysis and applicability of the interpolation at three operating frequencies of 15 21225 and 38 ghz locally used in singapore some new tcs values are obtained from the new fast and efficient interpolation with a good accuracy challenges and trends in discrete manufacturing over 50 years ago the 100000 workers at fords rouge automobile factory turned out 1200 cars per day nowadays fords plant on that same site still produces 800 cars each day but with just 3000 workers similar stories abound in the manufacturing industries technology revolution and evolution a shift from vertical integration better business and production practices and improved industrial relationsall have changed manufacturing beyond recognition so what are the current challenges and trends in manufacturing certainly the relentless advance of technology will continue as will user pressure for more customized design or improved environmental friendliness some trends are already with us and more as yet indiscernible will come but one major fundamental shift now resounding throughout industry is the way in which information involving every single aspect of the manufacturing process is being integrated into one seamless system on the beth properties of some intuitionistic modal logics let l be one of the intuitionistic modal logics as in the classical modal case we define two different forms of the beth property for l which are denoted by b1 and b2 in this paper we study the relation among b1 b2 and the interpolation properties c1 and c2 it turns out that c1 implies b1 but contrary to the boolean case is not equivalent to b1 it is shown that b2 and c2 are independent and moreover it comes out that in contrast to classical case there exists an extension of the intuitionistic modal logic of ssub 4type that has not the property b2 finally we give two algebraic properties that characterize respectively b1 and b2 more constructions for boolean algebras we construct boolean algebras with prescribed behaviour concerning depth for the free product of two boolean algebras over a third in zfc using pcf assuming squares we get results on ultraproducts we also deal with the family of cardinalities and topological density of homomorphic images of boolean algebras you can translate it to topologyon the cardinalities of closed subspaces and lastly we deal with inequalities between cardinal invariants mainly dbsup kappa b

been consistently successful for several decades without ever needing to reexamine or change their basic operating model however gradual but inexorable change in client expectations and the business environment over recent years now means that more of the same is no longer enough in future law firms will increasingly need to exploit it more effectively in order to remain competitive to do this they will need to ensure that all their information systems function as an integrated whole and are available to their staff clients and business partners the authors set out the lessons to be learned

author reports on the case and offers his comments finally some sensible european legislation on software the european commission has formally tabled a draft directive on the protection by patents of computerimplemented inventions the aim of this very important directive is to harmonise national patent laws relating to inventions using software it follows an extensive consultation launched by the commission in october 2000 the impetus behind the directive was the recognition at eu level of a total lack of unity between the european patent office and european national courts in deciding what was or was not deemed patentable when it came to the subject of computer programs cyberobscenity and the ambit of english criminal law the author looks at a recent case and questions the court of appeals approach in the authors submission the court of appeals decision in perrin was wrong p published no material in england and wales and should not have been convicted of any offence under english law even if it were proved that he sought to attract english subscribers to his site that may be an unpalatable conclusion but if the content of foreignhosted internet sites is to be

factors involved when choosing a firm to help set up or improve a web site 1 look for a company that combines technical skills and business experience 2 look for a company that offers excellent customer service 3 check that the web site firm is committed to developing and proactively updating the web site 4 make sure the firm has a proven track record and a good portfolio 5 look for a company with both a breadth as well as depth of skills 6 make sure the firm can deliver work on target in budget and to specification 7 ensure that you will enjoy working and feel comfortable with the web site firm staff why your web strategy is err wrong an awkward look at a few standard views from the author who thinks that most people have got it err wrong like every other investment when the time comes to sign the contract the question that should be asked is not whether it is a good investment but whether it is the best investment the firm can make with the money the author argues that he would be surprised if any law firm web site he has seen yet would jump that particular hurdle a humanists legacy in medical informatics visions and accomplishments of professor jeanraoul scherrer the objective is to report on the work of prof jeanraoul scherrer and show how his humanist vision medical skills and scientific background have enabled and shaped the development of medical informatics over the last 30 years starting with the mainframebased patientcentred hospital information system diogene in the 70s prof scherrer developed implemented and evolved innovative concepts of manmachine interfaces distributed and federated environments leading the way with information systems that obstinately focused on the support of care providers and patients through a rigorous design of terminologies and ontologies the diogene data would then serve as a basis for the development of clinical research data mining and lead to innovative natural language processing techniques in parallel prof scherrer supported the development of medical image management ranging from a distributed picture archiving and communication systems pacs to molecular imaging of protein electrophoreses recognizing the need for improving the quality and trustworthiness of medical information of the web prof scherrer created the healthonthe net hon foundation these achievements made possible thanks to his visionary mind deep humanism creativity generosity and determination have made of prof scherrer a true pioneer and leader of the humancentered patientoriented application of information technology for improving healthcare medicine in the 21 st century global problems global solutions the objectives are to discuss application areas of information technology in medicine and health care on the occasion of the opening of the private universitat fur medizinische informatik and technik tiroluniversity for health informatics and technology tyrol limit at innsbruck tyrol austria important application areas of information technology in medicine and health are appropriate individual access to medical knowledge new engineering developments such as new radiant imaging methods and the implantable pacemakerdefibrillator devices mathematical modeling for understanding the workings of the human body the computerbased patient record as well as new knowledge in molecular biology human genetics and biotechnology challenges and responsibilities for medical informatics research include medical data privacy and intellectual property rights inherent in the content of the information systems guidelines the internet and personal health insights from the canadian healnet experience the objectives are to summarize the insights gained in collaborative research in a canadian network of centres of excellence devoted to the promotion of evidencebased practice and to relate this experience to internet support of health promotion and consumer health informatics a subjective review of insights is undertaken work directed the development of systems incorporating guidelines care maps etc for use by professionals met with limited acceptance evidencebased tools for health care consumers are a desirable complement but require radically different content and delivery modes in addition to evidencebased material offered by professionals a wide array of internetbased products and services provided by consumers for consumers emerged and proved a beneficial complement the consumerdriven products and services provided via the internet are a potentially important and beneficial complement of traditional health services they affect the health consumerprovider roles and require changes in healthcare practices iscsi poised to lower san costs it managers building storage area networks or expanding their capacity may be able to save money by using iscsi and ip systems rather than fibre channel technologies standard protocol for exchange of healthcheckup data based on sgml the healthcheckup data markup language hdml the objectives are to develop a healthmedical data interchange model for efficient electronic exchange of data among healthcheckup facilities a healthcheckup data markup language hdml was developed on the basis of the standard generalized markup language sgml and a feasibility study carried out involving data exchange between two health checkup facilities the structure of hdml is described the transfer of numerical lab data summary findings and health status assessment was successful hdml is an improvement to laboratory data exchange further work has to address the exchange of qualitative and textual data development of a health guidance support system for lifestyle improvement the objective is to provide automated advice for lifestyle adjustment based on an assessment of the results of a questionnaire and medical examination or health checkup data a system was developed that gathers data based on questions regarding weight gain exercise smoking sleep eating habits salt intake animal fat intake snacks alcohol and oral hygiene body mass index resting blood pressure fasting blood sugar total cholesterol triglycerides uric acid and liver function tests based on the relationships between the lifestyle data and the health checkup data a health assessment sheet was generated for persons being allocated to a multiplerisk factor syndrome group health assessment and useful advice for lifestyle improvement were automatically extracted with the system toward the high risk group for life style related diseases the system is operational in comparison with conventional limited advice methods we developed a practical system that defined the necessity for lifestyle improvement more clearly and made giving advice easier organization design the continuing influence of information technology drawing from an information processing perspective this paper examines how information technology it has been a catalyst in the development of new forms of organizational structures the article draws a historical linkage between the relative stability of an organizations task environment starting after the second world war to the present environmental instability that now characterizes many industries specifically the authors suggest that advances in it have enabled managers to adapt existing forms and create new models for organizational design that better fit requirements of an unstable environment time has seemingly borne out this hypothesis as the bureaucratic structure evolved to the matrix to the network and now to the emerging shadow structure it has gone from a support mechanism to a substitute for organizational structures in the form of the shadow structure the article suggests that the evolving and expanding role of it will continue for organizations that face unstable environments knowledgebased structures and organisational commitment organisational commitment the emotional attachment of an employee to the employing organisation has attracted a substantial body of literature relating the concept to various antecedents including organisational structure and to a range of consequences including financially important performance factors such as productivity and staff turnover the new areas of knowledge management and learning organisations offer substantial promise as imperatives for the organisation of business enterprises as organisations in the contemporary environment adopt knowledgebased structures to improve their competitive position there is value in examining these structures against other performance related factors theoretical knowledgebased structures put forward by r miles et al 1997 and j quinn et al 1996 and an existing implementation are examined to determine common features inherent in these approaches these features are posited as a typical form and their impact on organisational commitment and hence on individual and organisational performance is examined the evolution of information systems their impact on organizations and structures information systems and organization structures have been highly interconnected with each other over the years information systems architectures as well as organization structures have evolved from centralized to more decentralized forms this research looks at the evolution of both information systems and organization structures in the process it looks into the impact of computers on organizations and examines the ways organization structures have changed in association with changes in information system architectures it also suggests logical linkages between information system architectures and their fit with certain organization structures and strategies it concludes with some implications for emerging and future organizational forms and provides a quick review of the effect of the internet on small businesses traditionally using standalone computers in search of a general enterprise model many organisations particularly smes are reluctant to invest time and money in models to support decision making such reluctance could be overcome if a model could be used for several purposes rather than using a traditional single perspective model this requires the development of a general enterprise model gem which can be applied to a wide range of problem domains with unlimited scope current enterprise modelling frameworks only deal effectively with nondynamic modelling issues whilst dynamic modelling issues have traditionally only been addressed at the operational level although the majority of research in this area relates to manufacturing companies the framework for a gem must be equally applicable to service and public sector organisations the paper identifies five key design issues that need to be considered when constructing a gem a framework for such a gem is presented based on a plug and play methodology and demonstrated by a simple case study strategies for high throughput templated zeolite synthesis the design and redesign of high throughput experiments for zeolite synthesis are addressed a model that relates materials function to the chemical composition of the zeolite and the structure directing agent is introduced using this model several monte carlolike design protocols are evaluated multiround protocols are bound to be effective and strategies that use a priori information about the structuredirecting libraries are found to be the best variable structure intelligent control for pm synchronous servo motor drive the variable structure control vsc of discrete time systems based on intelligent control is presented in this paper a novel approach is proposed for the state estimation a linear observer is firstly designed then a neural network is used for compensating uncertainty the parameter of the vsc scheme is adjusted online by a neural network practical operating results from a pm synchronous motor pmsm illustrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed approach a nonlinear modulation strategy for hybrid acdc power systems a nonlinear control strategy to improve transient stability of a multimachine ac power system with several dc links terminated in the presence of large disturbances is presented the approach proposed in this paper is based on differential geometric theory and the hvdc systems are taken as a variable admittance connected at the inverter or rectifier ac bus after deriving the analytical description of the relationship between the variable admittance and active power flows of each generator the traditional generator dynamic equations can thus be expressed with the variable admittance of hvdc systems as an additional state variable and changed to an affine form which is suitable for global linearization method being used to determine its control variable an important feature of the proposed method is that the modulated dc power is an adaptive and nonlinear function of ac system states and it can be realized by local feedback and less transmitted data from adjacent generators the design procedure is tested on a dualinfeed hybrid acdc system

space model using unified privacy tagging conchat a contextaware chat program conchat is a contextaware chat program that enriches electronic communication by providing contextual information and resolving potential semantic conflicts between usersconchat uses contextual information to improve electronic communication using contextual cues users can infer during a conversation what the other person is doing and what is happening in his or her immediate surroundings for example if a user learns that the other person is talking with somebody else or is involved in some urgent activity he or she knows to expect a slower response conversely if the user learns that the other person is sitting in a meeting directly related to the conversation he or she then knows to respond more quickly also by informing users about the other persons context and tagging potentially ambiguous chat messages conchat explores how context can improve electronic communication by reducing semantic conflicts a

reaction with subsequent ultrathinlayer gel electrophoresis of dna largescale genotyping mapping and expression profiling require affordable fully automated highthroughput devices enabling rapid highperformance analysis using minute quantities of reagents in this paper we describe a new combination of microwell polymerase chain reaction pcr based dna amplification technique with automated ultrathinlayer gel electrophoresis analysis of the resulting products this technique decreases the reagent consumption total reaction volume 0751 mu l the time requirement of the pcr 1520 min and subsequent ultrathinlayer gel electrophoresis based fragment analysis 5 min by automating the current manual procedure and reducing the human intervention using sample loading robots and computerized real time data analysis small aliquots 02 mu l of the submicroliter size pcr reaction were transferred onto loading membranes and analyzed by ultrathinlayer gel electrophoresis which is a novel highperformance and automated microseparation technique this system employs integrated scanning laserinduced fluorescenceavalanche photodiode detection and combines the advantages of conventional slab

imaging and data analysis simple minds health care it a few things done properly and soon is the shortterm strategy for the uk nhs it programme can it deliver this time absorption of long waves by nonresonant parametric microstructures using simple acoustical and mechanical models we consider the conceptual possibility of designing an active absorbing nonreflecting coating in the form of a thin layer with smallscale stratification and fast time modulation of parameters algorithms for spacetime modulation of the controlledlayer structure are studied in detail for a onedimensional boundaryvalue problem these algorithms do not require wavefield measurements which eliminates the selfexcitation problem that is characteristic of active systems the majority of the considered algorithms of parametric control transform the lowfrequency incident wave to highfrequency waves of the technological band for which the waveguiding medium inside the layer is assumed to be opaque absorbing the efficient use conditions are found for all the algorithms it is shown that the absorbing layer can be as thin as desired with respect to the minimum spatial scale of the incident wave and ensures efficient absorption in a wide frequency interval starting from zero frequency that is bounded from above only by a finite spacetime resolution of the parametercontrol operations the structure of a threedimensional parametric black coating whose efficiency is independent of the angle of incidence of an incoming wave is developed on the basis of the studied onedimensional problems the general solution of the problem of diffraction of incident waves from such a coating is obtained this solution is analyzed in detail for the case of a diskshaped element 2002 inhouse fulfillment

fulfillment rfp publishing for the uninitiated writing a request for proposal can seem both mysterious and daunting heres a format that will make you look like a pro the first time out library services today and tomorrow lessons from ilumina a digital library for creating and sharing teaching resources this article is based on the emerging experience associated with a digital library of instructional resources ilumina in which the contributors of resources and the users of those resources are the samean open community of instructors in science mathematics engineering and technology moreover it is not the resources most of which will be distributed across the internet but metadata about the resources that is the focus of the central ilumina repository and its support services for resource contributors and users the distributed ilumina library is a communitysharing library for repurposing and adding value to potentially useful mostly noncommercial instructional resources that are typically more granular in nature than commercially developed course materials the experience of developing ilumina is raising a range of issues that have nothing to do with the place and time characteristics of the instructional context in which ilumina instructional resources are created or used the issues instead have their locus in the democratization of both the professional roles of librarians and the quality assurance mechanisms associated with traditional peer review the canadian national site licensing project in january 2000 a consortium of 64 universities in canada signed a historic interinstitutional agreement that launched the canadian national site licensing project cnslp a threeyear pilot project aimed at bolstering the research and innovation capacity of the countrys universities cnslp tests the feasibility of licensing on a national scale electronic versions of scholarly publications in its initial phases the project is focused on fulltext electronic journals and research databases in science engineering health and environmental disciplines this article provides an overview of the cnslp initiative summarizes organizational and licensing accomplishments to date and offers preliminary observations on challenges and opportunities for subsequent phases of the project the uks national electronic site licensing initiative nesli in 1998 the uk created the national electronic site licensing initiative nesli to increase and improve access to electronic journals and to negotiate license agreements on behalf of academic libraries the use of a model license agreement and the success of site licensing is discussed highlights from an interim evaluation by the joint information systems committee jisc are noted and key issues and questions arising from the evaluation are identified the role of caul council of australian libraries in consortial purchasing the council of australian university librarians constituted in 1965 for the purposes of cooperative action and the sharing of information assumed the role of consortial purchasing agent in 1996 on behalf of its members and associate organisations in australia and new zealand this role continues to grow in tandem with the burgeoning of electronic publication and the acceptance of publishers of the advantages of dealing with consortia the needs of the australian university community overlap significantly with consortia in north america and europe but important differences are highlighted licensing experiences in the netherlands the licensing strategy of university libraries in the netherlands is closely connected with university policies to develop document servers and to make research publications available on the web national agreements have been made with major publishers such as elsevier science and kluwer academic to provide access to a wide range of scientific information and to experiment with new ways of providing information and new business models international library consortia positive starts promising futures library consortia have grown substantially over the past ten years both within north america and globally as this resurgent consortial movement has begun to mature and as publishers and vendors have begun to adapt to consortial purchasing models consortia have expanded their agendas for action the movement to globalize consortia is traced including the development and current work of the international coalition of library consortiaicolc a methodology is explored to classify library consortia by articulating the key factors that affect and distinguish consortia as organizations within three major areas strategic tactical and practical or managerial concerns common consortial values are examined and a list of known international library consortia is presented the open archives initiative realizing simple and effective digital library interoperability the open archives initiative oai is dedicated to solving problems of digital library interoperability its focus has been on defining simple protocols most recently for the exchange of metadata from archives the oai evolved out of a need to increase access to scholarly publications by supporting the creation of interoperable digital libraries as a first step towards such interoperability a metadata harvesting protocol was developed to support the streaming of metadata from one repository to another ultimately to a provider of user services such as browsing searching or annotation this article provides an overview of the mission philosophy and technical framework of the oai content standards for electronic books the oebf publication structure and the role of public interest participation in the emerging world of electronic publishing how we create distribute and read books will be in a large part determined by an underlying framework of content standards that establishes the range of technological opportunities and constraints for publishing and reading systems but efforts to develop content standards based on sound engineering models must skillfully negotiate competing and sometimes apparently irreconcilable objectives if they are to produce results relevant to the rapidly changing course of technology the open ebook forums publication structure an xmlbased specification for electronic books is an example of the sort of timely and innovative problem solving required for successful realworld standards development as a result of this effort the electronic book industry will not only happen sooner and on a larger scale than it would have otherwise but the electronic books it produces will be more functional more interoperable and more accessible to all readers public interest participants have a critical role in this process fuzzy modeling based on generalized conjunction operations an approach to fuzzy modeling based on the tuning of parametric conjunction operations is proposed first some methods for the construction of parametric generalized conjunction operations simpler than the known parametric classes of conjunctions are considered and discussed second several examples of function approximation by fuzzy models based on the tuning of the parameters of the new conjunction operations are given and their approximation performances are compared with the approaches based on a tuning of membership functions and other approaches proposed in the literature it is seen that the tuning of the conjunction operations can be used for obtaining fuzzy models with a sufficiently good performance when the tuning of membership functions is not possible or not desirable project euclid and the role of research libraries in scholarly publishing project euclid a joint electronic journal publishing initiative of cornell university library and duke university press is discussed in the broader contexts of the changing patterns of scholarly communication and the publishing scene of mathematics specific aspects of the project such as partnerships and the creation of an economic model are presented as well as what it takes to be a publisher libraries have gained important and relevant experience through the creation and management of digital libraries but they need to develop further skills if they want to adopt a new role in the life cycle of scholarly communication perspectives on scholarly online books the columbia university online books evaluation project the online books evaluation project at columbia university studied the potential for scholarly online books from 1995 to 1999 issues included scholars interest in using online books the role they might play in scholarly life features that scholars and librarians sought in online books the costs of producing and owning print and online books and potential marketplace arrangements scholars see potential for online books to make their research learning and teaching more efficient and effective librarians see potential to serve their scholars better librarians may face lower costs if they can serve their scholars with online books instead of print books publishers may be able to offer scholars greater opportunities to use their books while enhancing their own profitability the california digital library and the escholarship program the escholarship program was launched in 2000 to foster facultyled innovation in scholarly publishing an initiative of the university of california uc and a program of the california digital library the escholarship program has stimulated significant interest in its short life its modest but visible accomplishments garner praise from many quarters within and beyond the university of california in perhaps the best indication of its timeliness and momentum there are more proposals submitted to escholarship today than the cdl can manage this early success is due in part to the sheer power of an idea whose time has come but also to the unique approach on which cdl was founded and the escholarship initiative was first launched bioone a new model for scholarly publishing this article describes a unique electronic journal publishing project involving the university of kansas the big 12 plus libraries consortium the american institute of biological sciences allen press and sparc the scholarly publishing and academic resources coalition this partnership has created bioone a database of 40 fulltext society journals in the biological and environmental sciences which was launched in april 2001 the genesis and development of the project is described and financial technical and intellectual property models for the project are discussed collaborative strategies for the project are described symbiosis or alienation advancing the university pressresearch library relationship through electronic scholarly communication university presses and research libraries have a long tradition of collaboration the rapidly expanding electronic scholarly communication environment offers important new opportunities for cooperation and for innovative new models of publishing the economics of libraries and scholarly publishers have strained the working relationship and promoted debates on important information policy issues this article explores the context for advancing the partnership cites examples of joint efforts in electronic publishing and presents an action plan for working together support vector machines model for classification of thermal error in machine tools this paper addresses a change in the concept of machine tool thermal error prediction which has been hitherto carried out by directly mapping them with the temperature of critical elements on the machine the model developed herein using support vector machines a powerful datatraining algorithm seeks to account for the impact of specific operating conditions in addition to temperature variation on the effective prediction of thermal errors several experiments were conducted to study the error pattern which was found to change significantly with variation in operating conditions this model attempts to classify the error based on operating conditions once classified the error is then predicted based on the temperature states this paper also briefly describes the concept of the implementation of such a comprehensive model along with an online error assessment and calibration system in a pcbased openarchitecture controller environment so that it could be employed in regular production for the purpose of periodic calibration of machine tools adaptive and efficient mutual exclusion the paper presents adaptive algorithms for mutual exclusion using only read and write operations the performance of the algorithms depends only on the point contention ie the number of processes that are concurrently active during algorithm execution and not on n the total number of processes our algorithm has ok remote step complexity and olog k system response time where k is the point contention the remote step complexity is the maximal number of steps performed by a process where a wait is counted as one step the system response time is the time interval between subsequent entries to the critical section where one time unit is the minimal interval in which every active process performs at least one step the space complexity of this algorithm is on log n where n is the range of process names we show how to make the space complexity of our algorithm depend solely on n while preserving the other performance measures of the algorithm the congenial talking philosophers problem in computer networks group mutual exclusion occurs naturally in situations where a resource can be shared by processes of the same group but not by processes of different groups for example suppose data is stored in a cdjukebox then when a disc is loaded for access users that need data on the disc can concurrently access the disc while users that need data on a different disc have to wait until the current disc is unloaded the design issues for group mutual exclusion have been modeled as the congenial talking philosophers problem and solutions for shared memory models have been proposed yj young 2000 p keane and m moir 1999 as in ordinary mutual exclusion and many other problems in distributed systems however techniques developed for shared memory do not necessarily apply to message passing and vice versa we investigate solutions for congenial talking philosophers in computer networks where processes communicate by asynchronous message passing we first present a solution that is a straightforward adaptation from g ricart and ak agrawalas 1981 algorithm for ordinary mutual exclusion then we show that the simple modification suffers a severe performance degradation that could cause the system to behave as though only one process of a group can be in the critical section at a time we then present a more efficient and highly concurrent distributed algorithm for the problem the first such solution in computer networks universal dynamic synchronous selfstabilization we prove the existence of a universal synchronous selfstabilizing protocol that is a protocol that allows a distributed system to stabilize to a desired nonreactive behaviour as long as a protocol stabilizing to that behaviour exists previous proposals required drastic increases in asymmetry and knowledge to work whereas our protocol does not use any additional knowledge and does not require more symmetrybreaking conditions than available thus it is also stabilizing with respect to dynamic changes in the topology we prove an optimal quiescence time n  d for a synchronous network of n processors and diameter d the protocol can be made finite state with a negligible loss in quiescence time moreover an optimal d  1 protocol is given for the case of unique identifiers as a consequence we provide an effective proof technique that allows one to show whether selfstabilization to a certain behaviour is possible under a wide range of models randomized twoprocess waitfree testandset we present the first explicit and currently simplest randomized algorithm for twoprocess waitfree testandset it is implemented with two 4valued single writer single reader atomic variables a testandset takes at most 11 expected elementary steps while a reset takes exactly 1 elementary step based on a finitestate analysis the proofs of correctness and expected length are compressed into one table identification of evolving fuzzy rulebased models an approach to identification of evolving fuzzy rulebased er models is proposed er models implement a method for the noniterative update of both the rulebase structure and parameters by incremental unsupervised learning the rulebase evolves by adding more informative rules than those that previously formed the model in addition existing rules can be replaced with new rules based on ranking using the informative potential of the data in this way the rulebase structure is inherited and updated when new informative data become available rather than being completely retrained the adaptive nature of these evolving rulebased models in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules makes them a promising candidate for modeling and control of complex processes competitive to neural networks the approach has been tested on a benchmark problem and on an airconditioning component modeling application using data from an installation serving a real building the results illustrate the viability and efficiency of the approach aim for the enterprise microsoft project 2002 a longtime favorite of project managers microsoft project 2002 is making its enterprise debut its new webbased collaboration tools and improved scalability with olap support make it much easier to manage multiple web projects with disparate workgroups and budgets central hub for design assets adobe golive 60 adobe golive is a strong contender for web authoring and publishing version 60 features a flexible gui environment combined with a comprehensive workgroup and collaboration server plus tight integration with leading design tools reaching for five nines activewatch and siteseer every web admins dream is achieving the fabled five nines99999 percent uptime to attain such availability your web site must be down no more than about five minutes per year technologies like raid clustering and load balancing make this easier but to actually track uptime maintain auditable records and discover patterns in failures to prevent downtime in the future youll need to set up external monitoring because your internet connection is a key factor in measuring uptime you must monitor your site from the internet itself beyond your firewall you could monitor with custom software on remote hosts or you could use one of the two reasonably priced services available mercury interactives activewatch and freshwater softwares siteseer freshwater software has been a subsidiary of mercury interactive for about a year now the two services offer a slightly different mix of features and target different markets both services offer availability and performance monitoring from several remote locations alerts to email or pager and periodic reports they differ in whats most easily monitored and in the way you interact with the services accessible streaming content make sure your web site is offering quality service to all your users the article provides some tips and tactics for making your streaming media accessible accessibility of streaming content for people with disabilities is often not part of the spec for multimedia projects but it certainly affects your quality of service most of the resources available on web accessibility deal with html fortunately rich media and streaming content developers have a growing number of experts to turn to for information and assistance the essentials of providing accessible streaming content are simple blind and visually impaired people need audio to discern important visual detail and interface elements while deaf and hardofhearing people need text to access sound effects and dialog actually implementing these principles is quite a challenge though now due to a relatively new law in the us known as section 508 dealing with accessibility issues is becoming an essential part of publishing on the web what you get is what you see web performance monitoring to get the best possible performance from your web infrastructure youll need a complete view dont neglect the big picture because youre too busy concentrating on details the increasing complexity of web sites and the content they provide has consequently increased the complexity of the infrastructure that supports them but with some knowledge of networking a handful of useful tools and the insight that those tools provide designing and operating for optimal performance and reliability is within your grasp the culture of usability now that most of us agree that usability testing is an integral investment in site development its time to recognize that the standard approach falls short it is possible to do less work and get better results while spending less money by bringing usability testing inhouse and breaking tests into more manageable sessions you can vastly improve your online offering without affecting your profit margin debugging web applications the author considers how one can save time tracking down bugs in webbased applications by arming yourself with the right tools and programming practices a wide variety of debugging tools have been written with web developers in mind unsafe at any speed while sun prides itself on javas secure sandbox programming model microsoft takes a looser approach its c language incorporates clike concepts including pointers and memory management but is unsafe code really a boon to programmers or is it a step backward building digital collections at the oac current strategies with a view to future uses providing a context for the exploration of user defined virtual collections the article describes the history and recent development of the online archive of california oac stating that usability and user needs are primary factors in digital resource development issues explored include collaborations to build digital collections reliance upon professional standards for description and encoding system architecture interface design the need for user tools and the role of archivists as interpreters in the digital environment nuts and bolts implementing descriptive standards to enable virtual collections to date online archival information systems have relied heavily on legacy finding aids for data to encode and provide to end users despite fairly strong indications in the archival literature that such legacy data is problematic even as a mediated access tool archivists have only just begun to study the utility of archival descriptive data for end users in unmediated settings such as via the web the ability of future archival information systems to respond to the expectations and needs of end users is inextricably linked to archivists getting their collective data house in order the general international standard archival description isadg offers the profession a place from which to start extricating ourselves from the idiosyncracies of our legacy data and description practices learning weights for the quasiweighted means we study the determination of weights for quasiweighted means also called quasilinear means when a set of examples is given we consider first a simple case the learning of weights for weighted means and then we extend the approach to the more general case of a quasiweighted mean we consider the case of a known arbitrary generator f the paper finishes considering the use of parametric functions that are suitable when the values to aggregate are measure values or ratio prospecting virtual collections virtual collections are a distinct subspecies of digital collections and digital archives archivists and curators as archivists and curators do not construct virtual collections rather they enable virtual collections through the application of descriptive and other standards virtual collections are constructed by end users union outreach  a pilgrims progress as the american labor movement continues on its path toward reorganization and rejuvenation archivists are challenged to ensure that the organizational political and cultural changes labor unions are experiencing are fully documented the article examines the need for labor archivists to reach out actively to unions and the problems they face in getting their message across not only to union leadership but also to union members outreach by labor archivists is vital on three critical fronts the need to secure union funding in support of labor archival programs obtaining union cooperation in reviewing and amending obsolete deposit agreements and coordinating efforts with unions to save the records of closing district and local union offices attempting to resolve these outstanding issues labor archivists are pulled between two distinct institutional cultures one academic in nature the other enmeshed in a union bureaucracy and often have their own labor archival programs compromised by the internal dynamics and politics inherent in administering large academic libraries and unions if labor archivists are to be successful they must find their collective voice within the labor movement and establish their relevancy to unions during a period of momentous change and restructuring moreover archivists need to give greater thought to designing and implementing outreach programs that bridge the fundamental disconnect between union bureaucracies and the rank and file and unions and the public the impact of ead adoption on archival programs a pilot survey of early implementers the article reports the results of a survey conducted to assess the impact that the implementation of encoded archival description ead has on archival programs by gathering data related to the funding staffing and evaluation of ead programs and about institutional goals for ead implementation the study explored how ead has affected the operations of the institutions which are utilizing it and the extent to which ead has become a part of regular repository functions k12 instruction and digital access to archival materials providing k12 schools with digital access to archival materials can strengthen both student learning and archival practice although it cannot replace direct physical access to records the article compares a variety of electronic and nonelectronic projects to promote teaching with primary source materials the article also examines some of the different historiographical and pedagogical approaches used in archival web sites geared for k12 instruction focusing on differences between the educational sites sponsored by the library of congress and the national archives and records administration the archival imagination of david bearman revisited many archivists regard the archival imagination evidenced in the writings of david bearman as avantgarde archivist l henry 1998 has sharply criticized bearman for being irreverent toward the archival theory and practice outlined by classical american archivist t r schellenberg although bearman is sometimes credited and sometimes berated for establishing a new paradigm centered on the archival management of electronic records his methods and strategies are intended to encompass all forms of record keeping the article provides general observations on bearmans archival imagination lists some of its components and addresses elements of henrys critique although the long lasting impact of bearmans imagination upon the archival profession might be questioned it nonetheless deserves continued consideration by archivists and inclusion as a component of graduate archival education pattern recognition strategies for molecular surfaces ii surface complementarity for pti see ibid vol23 p117687 2002 fuzzy logic based algorithms for the quantitative treatment of complementarity of molecular surfaces are presented therein the overlapping surface patches defined in part i of this series are used the identification of complementary surface patches can be considered as a first step for the solution of molecular docking problems standard technologies can then be used for further optimization of the resulting complex structures the algorithms are applied to 33 biomolecular complexes after the optimization with a downhill simplex method for all these complexes one structure was found which is in very good agreement with the experimental results pattern recognition strategies for molecular surfaces i pattern generation using fuzzy set theory a new method for the characterization of molecules based on the model approach of molecular surfaces is presented we use the topographical properties of the surface as well as the electrostatic potential the local lipophilicityhydrophilicity and the hydrogen bond density on the surface for characterization the definition and the calculation method for these properties are reviewed the surface is segmented into overlapping patches with similar molecular properties these patches can be used to represent the characteristic local features of the molecule in a way that is beyond the atomistic resolution but can nevertheless be applied for the analysis of partial similarities of different molecules as well as for the identification of molecular complementarity in a very general sense the patch representation can be used for different applications which will be demonstrated in subsequent articles an efficient parallel algorithm for the calculation of canonical mp2 energies we present the parallel version of a previous serial algorithm for the efficient calculation of canonical mp2 energies it is based on the saeboalmlof directintegral transformation coupled with an efficient prescreening of the ao integrals the parallel algorithm avoids synchronization delays by spawning a second set of slaves during the binsort prior to the second halftransformation results are presented for systems with up to 2000 basis functions mp2 energies for molecules with 400500 basis functions can be routinely calculated to microhartree accuracy on a small number of processors 68 in a matter of minutes with modern pcbased parallel computers a method for correlations analysis of coordinates applications for molecular conformations we describe a new method to analyze multiple correlations between subsets of coordinates that represent a sample the correlation is established only between specific regions of interest at the coordinates first the regions of interest are selected at each molecular coordinate next a correlation matrix is constructed for the selected regions the matrix is subject to further analysis illuminating the multidimensional structural characteristics that exist in the conformational space the methods abilities are demonstrated in several examples it is used to analyze the conformational space of complex molecules it is successfully applied to compare related conformational spaces and it is used to analyze a diverse set of protein folding trajectories genetic algorithm guided selection variable selection and subset selection a novel genetic algorithm guided selection method gas has been described the method utilizes a simple encoding scheme which can represent both compounds and variables used to construct a qsarqspr model a genetic algorithm is then utilized to simultaneously optimize the encoded variables that include both descriptors and compound subsets the gas method generates multiple models each applying to a subset of the compounds typically the subsets represent clusters with different chemotypes also a procedure based on molecular similarity is presented to determine which model should be applied to a given test set compound the variable selection method implemented in gas has been tested and compared using the selwood data set n  31 compounds nu  53 descriptors the results showed that the method is comparable to other published methods the subset selection method implemented in gas has been first tested using an artificial data set n  100 points nu  1 descriptor to examine its ability to subset data points and second applied to analyze the xlogp data set n  1831 compounds nu  126 descriptors the method is able to correctly identify artificial data points belonging to various subsets the analysis of the xlogp data set shows that the subset selection method can be useful in improving a qsarqspr model when the variable selection method fails a formal model of computing with words classical automata are formal models of computing with values fuzzy automata are generalizations of classical automata where the knowledge about the systems next state is vague or uncertain it is worth noting that like classical automata fuzzy automata can only process strings of input symbols therefore such fuzzy automata are still abstract devices for computing with values although a certain vagueness or uncertainty are involved in the process of computation we introduce a new kind of fuzzy automata whose inputs are instead strings of fuzzy subsets of the input alphabet these new fuzzy automata may serve as formal models of computing with words we establish an extension principle from computing with values to computing with words this principle indicates that computing with words can be implemented with computing with values with the price of a big amount of extra computations using molecular equivalence numbers to visually explore structural features that distinguish chemical libraries a molecular equivalence number meqnum classifies a molecule with respect to a class of structural features or topological shapes such as its cyclic system or its set of functional groups meqnums can be used to organize molecular structures into nonoverlapping yet highly relatable classes we illustrate the construction of some different types of meqnums and present via examples some methods of comparing diverse chemical libraries based on meqnums in the examples we compare a library which is a random sample from the mdl drug data report mddr with a library which is a random sample from the available chemical directory acd in our analyses we discover some interesting features of the topological shape of a molecule and its set of functional groups that are strongly linked with compounds occurring in the mddr but not in the acd we also illustrate the utility of molecular equivalence indices in delineating the structural domain over which an sar conclusion is valid on the use of neural network ensembles in qsar and qspr despite their growing popularity among neural network practitioners ensemble methods have not been widely adopted in structureactivity and structureproperty correlation neural networks are inherently unstable in that small changes in the training set andor training parameters can lead to large changes in their generalization performance recent research has shown that by capitalizing on the diversity of the individual models ensemble techniques can minimize uncertainty and produce more stable and accurate predictors in this work we present a critical assessment of the most common ensemble technique known as bootstrap aggregation or bagging as applied to qsar and qspr although aggregation does offer definitive advantages we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results these findings are rationalized using krogh and vedelsbys 1995 decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them for networks that are designed to resist overfitting the benefits of aggregation are clear but not overwhelming median partitioning a novel method for the selection of representative subsets from large compound pools a method termed median partitioning mp has been developed to select diverse sets of molecules from large compound pools unlike many other methods for subset selection the mp approach does not depend on pairwise comparison of molecules and can therefore be applied to very large compound collections the only time limiting step is the calculation of molecular descriptors for database compounds mp employs arrays of property descriptors with little correlation to divide large compound pools into partitions from which representative molecules can be selected in each of n subsequent steps a population of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median value of a property descriptor until a desired number of 2sup n partitions are obtained for descriptor evaluation and selection an entropy formulation was embedded in a genetic algorithm mp has been applied to generate a subset of the available chemicals directory and the results have been compared with cellbased partitioning chemical information based scaling of molecular descriptors a universal chemical scale for library design and analysis scaling is a difficult issue for any analysis of chemical properties or molecular topology when disparate descriptors are involved to compare properties across different data sets a common scale must be defined using several publicly available databases acd cmc mddr and nci as a basis we propose to define chemically meaningful scales for a number of molecular properties and topology descriptors these chemically derived scaling functions have several advantages first it is possible to define chemically relevant scales greatly simplifying similarity and diversity analyses across data sets second this approach provides a convenient method for setting descriptor boundaries that define chemically reasonable topology spaces for example descriptors can be scaled so that compounds with little potential for biological activity bioavailability or other druglike characteristics are easily identified as outliers we have compiled scaling values for 314 molecular descriptors in addition the 10th and 90th percentile values for each descriptor have been calculated for use in outlier filtering mtdpls a plsbased variant of the mtd method ii mapping ligandreceptor interactions enzymatic acetic acid esters hydrolysis the pls variant of the mtd method ti oprea et al sar qsar environ res 2001 12 7592 was applied to a series of 25 acetylcholinesterase hydrolysis substrates statistically significant mtdpls models qsup 2 between 07 and 08 are in agreement with previous mtd models with the advantage that local contributions are understood beyond the occupancynonoccupancy interpretation in mtd a chemically intuitive approach further forces mtdpls coefficients to assume only negative or zero values for fragmental volume descriptors and positive or zero values for fragmental hydrophobicity descriptors this further separates the various kinds of local interactions at each vertex of the mtd hypermolecule making this method suitable for medicinal chemistry synthesis planning prediction of ultraviolet spectral absorbance using quantitative structureproperty relationships high performance liquid chromatography hplc with ultraviolet uv spectrophotometric detection is a common method for analyzing reaction products in organic chemistry this procedure would benefit from a computational model for predicting the relative response of organic molecules models are now reported for the prediction of the integrated uv absorbance for a diverse set of organic compounds using a quantitative structureproperty relationship qspr approach a sevendescriptor linear correlation with a squared correlation coefficient rsup 2 of 0815 is reported for a data set of 521compounds using the sum of zindo oscillator strengths in the integration range as an additional descriptor allowed reduction in the number of descriptors producing a robust model for 460 compounds with five descriptors and a squared correlation coefficient 0857 the descriptors used in the models are discussed with respect to the physical nature of the uv absorption process assessment of the macrocyclic effect for the complexation of crownethers with alkali cations using the substructural molecular fragments method the substructural molecular fragments method solovev v p varnek a a wipff g j chem inf comput sci 2000 40 847858 was applied to assess stability constants logk of the complexes of crownethers polyethers and glymes with nasup  ksup  and cssup  in methanol one hundred fortyseven computational models including different fragment sets coupled with linear or nonlinear fitting equations were applied for the data sets containing 69 nasup  123 ksup  and 31 cssup  compounds to account for the macrocyclic effect for crownethers an additional cyclicity descriptor was used predicted stability constants both for macrocyclic compounds and for their openchain analogues are in good agreement with the experimental data reported earlier and with those studied experimentally in this work the macrocyclic effect as a function of cation and ligand is quantitatively estimated for all studied crownethers improving the predicting power of partial order based qsars through linear extensions partial order theory pot is an attractive and operationally simple method that allows ordering of compounds based on selected structural andor electronic descriptors modeled order or based on their end points eg solubility experimental order if the modeled order resembles the experimental order compounds that are not experimentally investigated can be assigned a position in the model that eventually might lead to a prediction of an endpoint value however in the application of pot in quantitative structureactivity relationship modeling only the compounds directly comparable to the noninvestigated compounds are applied to explore the possibilities of improving the methodology the theory is extended by application of the socalled linear extensions of the model order the study show that partial ordering combined with linear extensions appears as a promising tool providing probability distribution curves in the range of possible endpoint values for compounds not being experimentally investigated novel zeisomerism descriptors derived from molecular topology and their application to qsar analysis we introduce several series of novel zeisomerism descriptors derived directly from twodimensional molecular topology these descriptors make use of a quantity named zeisomerism correction which is added to the vertex degrees of atoms connected by double bonds in z and e configurations this approach is similar to the one described previously for topological chirality descriptors golbraikh a et al j chem inf comput sci 2001 41 147158 the zeisomerism descriptors include modified molecular connectivity indices overall zagreb indices extended connectivity overall connectivity and topological charge indices they can be either real or complex numbers mathematical properties of different subgroups of zeisomerism descriptors are discussed these descriptors circumvent the inability of conventional topological indices to distinguish between z and e isomers the applicability of zeisomerism descriptors to qsar analysis is demonstrated in the studies of a series of 131 anticancer agents inhibiting tubulin polymerization computer mediated communication and university international students the design for the preliminary study presented was based on the experiences of the international students and faculty members of a small southwest university being surveyed and interviewed the data collection procedure blends qualitative and quantitative data a strong consensus was found that supports the studys premise that there is an association between the use of computer mediated communication cmc and teaching and learning performance of international students both groups believe cmc to be an effective teaching and learning tool by increasing the frequency and quality of communication between students and instructors improving language skills through increased writing and communication opportunities allowing students and instructors to stay current and to compete effectively providing alternative teaching and learning methods to increase students confidence in their ability to communicate effectively with peers and instructors and improving the instructors pedagogical focus and questioning techniques uncertainty bounds and their use in the design of interval type2 fuzzy logic systems we derive inner and outerbound sets for the typereduced set of an interval type2 fuzzy logic system fls based on a new mathematical interpretation of the karnikmendel iterative procedure for computing the typereduced set the bound sets can not only provide estimates about the uncertainty contained in the output of an interval type2 fls but can also be used to design an interval type2 fls we demonstrate by means of a simulation experiment that the resulting system can operate without typereduction and can achieve similar performance to one that uses typereduction therefore our new design method based on the bound sets can relieve the computation burden of an interval type2 fls during its operation which makes an interval type2 fls useful for realtime applications entrepreneurs in action a webcase model much of the traditional schooling in america is built around systems of compliance and control characteristics which stifle the creative and entrepreneurial instincts of the children who are subjected to these tactics the article explores a different approach to education one that involves capturing the interest of the student through the use of problem and projectbased instruction delivered via the internet called entrepreneurs in action this program seeks to involve students in a problem at the outset and to promote the learning of traditional subject areas as a process of the problemsolving activities that are undertaken the programs details are explained from elementary school through university level courses and the authors outline their plans to test the efficacy of the program at each level factors contributing to preservice teachers discomfort in a webbased course structured as an inquiry a report is given of a qualitative emergent design study of a science technology society interaction sts webenhanced course students discomfort during the pilot test provided insight into the intellectual scaffolding that preservice secondary science teachers needed to optimize their performance when required to develop understanding through openended inquiry in a web environment eight factors identified contributed to student discomfort computer skills paradigm shifts trust time management thinking about their own thinking systematic inquiry selfassessment and scientific discourse these factors suggested developing understanding through inquiry by conducting a selfdesigned openended systematic inquiry required autonomous learning involving metacognitive skills and time management skills to the extent in which students either came into the course with this scaffolding or developed it during the course they were successful in learning about sts and its relationship to science teaching changes in the web site made to accommodate learners needs as they surfaced are described recommendations for implementing internet inquiry projects the purpose of the study presented was to provide recommendations to teachers who are interested in implementing internet inquiry projects four classes of ninth and tenthgrade honors students n  100 participated in an internet inquiry project in which they were presented with an ecology question that required them to make a decision based on information that they gathered analyzed and synthesized from the internet and their textbook students then composed papers with a rationale for their decision students in one group had access to preselected relevant web sites access to the entire internet and were provided with less online support students in the other group had access to only preselected relevant web sites but were provided with more online support two of the most important recommendations were 1 to provide students with more online support and 2 to provide students with preselected relevant web sites and allow them to search the internet for information alien rescue a problembased hypermedia learning environment for middle school

technology the author has trained inservice teachers in southwestern louisiana with an advanced computer multimedia program called directorr macromedia inc the content of this course focused on modeling the projectbased learning pedagogy and researching acadians traditions and legacy with the multifunctions of microcomputers new technologies were used to preserve and celebrate the local culture with superiority of text graphics animation sound and video the article describes how several groups of school teachers in the surrounding areas of a regional state university of louisiana learned computer multimedia using projectbased learning and integrated their learning into local cultural heritage presentation media information complexity and learning outcomes multimedia computing provides a variety of information presentation modality combinations educators have observed that visuals enhance learning which suggests that multimedia presentations should be superior to textonly and text with static pictures in facilitating optimal human information processing and therefore comprehension the article reports the findings from a 3 textonly overhead slides and multimedia presentation2 high and low information complexity factorial experiment subjects read a text script viewed an acetate overhead slide presentation or viewed a multimedia presentation depicting the greenhouse effect low complexity or photocopier operation high complexity multimedia was superior to textonly and overhead slides for comprehension information complexity diminished comprehension and perceived presentation quality multimedia was able to reduce the negative impact of information complexity on comprehension and increase the extent of sustained attention to the presentation these findings suggest that multimedia presentations invoke the use of both the verbal and visual working memory channels resulting in a reduction of the cognitive load imposed by increased information complexity moreover multimedia superiority in facilitating comprehension goes beyond its ability to increase sustained attention the quality and effectiveness of information processing attained ie use of verbal and visual working memory is also significant realtime tissue characterization on the basis of in vivo raman spectra the application of in vivo raman spectroscopy for clinical diagnosis demands dedicated software that can perform the necessary signal processing and subsequent multivariate data analysis enabling clinically relevant parameters to be extracted and made available in real time here we describe the design and implementation of a software package that allows for realtime signal processing and data analysis of raman spectra the design is based on automatic data exchange between grams a spectroscopic data acquisition and analysis program and matlab a program designed for arraybased calculations the data analysis software has a modular design providing great flexibility in developing custom data analysis routines for different applications the implementation is illustrated by a computationally demanding application for the classification of skin spectra using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis loudspeaker voicecoil inductance losses circuit models parameter estimation and effect on frequency response when the series resistance is separated and treated as a separate element it is shown that losses in an inductor require the ratio of the flux to mmf in the core to be frequency dependent for smallsignal operation this dependence leads to a circuit model composed of a lossless inductor and a resistor in parallel both of which are frequency dependent mathematical expressions for these elements are derived under the assumption that the ratio of core flux to mmf varies as omega sup n1 where n is a constant a linear regression technique is described for extracting the model parameters from measured data experimental data are presented to justify the model for the lossy inductance of a loudspeaker voicecoil a spice example is presented to illustrate the effects of voicecoil inductor losses on the frequency response of a typical driver complexity transitions in global algorithms for sparse linear systems over finite fields we study the computational complexity of a very basic problem namely that of finding solutions to a very large set of random linear equations in a finite galois field modulo q using tools from statistical mechanics we are able to identify phase transitions in the structure of the solution space and to connect them to the changes in the performance of a global algorithm namely gaussian elimination crossing phase boundaries produces a dramatic increase in memory and cpu requirements necessary for the algorithms in turn this causes the saturation of the upper bounds for the running time we illustrate the results on the specific problem of integer factorization which is of central interest for deciphering messages encrypted with the rsa cryptosystem noise effect on memory recall in dynamical neural network model of hippocampus we investigate some noise effect on a neural network model proposed by araki and aihara 1998 for the memory recall of dynamical patterns in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex the noise effect is important since the release of transmitters at synaptic clefts the operation of gate of ion channels and so on are known as stochastic phenomena we consider two kinds of noise effect due to a deterministic noise and a stochastic noise by numerical simulations we find that reasonable values of noise give better performance on the memory recall of dynamical patterns furthermore we investigate the effect of the strength of external inputs on the memory recall fuzzy polynomial neural networks hybrid architectures of fuzzy modeling we introduce a concept of fuzzy polynomial neural networks fpnns a hybrid modeling architecture combining polynomial neural networks pnns and fuzzy neural networks fnns the development of the fpnns dwells on the technologies of computational intelligence ci namely fuzzy sets neural networks and genetic algorithms the structure of the fpnn results from a synergistic usage of fnn and pnn fnns contribute to the formation of the premise part of the rulebased structure of the fpnn the consequence part of the fpnn is designed using pnns the structure of the pnn is not fixed in advance as it usually takes place in the case of conventional neural networks but becomes organized dynamically to meet the required approximation error we exploit a group method of data handling gmdh to produce this dynamic topology of the network the performance of the fpnn is quantified through experimentation that exploits standard data already used in fuzzy modeling the obtained experimental results reveal that the proposed networks exhibit high accuracy and generalization capabilities in comparison to other similar fuzzy models mems applications in computer disk drive dualstage servo systems we present a decoupled discrete time pole placement design method which can be combined with a selftuning scheme to compensate variations in the microactuators mas resonance mode section i of the paper describes the design and fabrication of a prototype microactuator with an integrated gimbal structure section ii presents a decoupled trackfollowing controller design and a selftuning control scheme to compensate for the mas resonance mode variations nuclear magnetic resonance molecular photography a procedure is described for storing a twodimensional 2d pattern consisting of 32321024 bits in a spin state of a molecular system and then retrieving the stored information as a stack of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra the system used is a nematic liquid crystal the protons of which act as spin clusters with strong intramolecular interactions the technique used is a programmable multifrequency irradiation with low amplitude when it is applied to the liquid crystal a large number of coherent longlived sup 1h response signals can be excited resulting in a spectrum showing many sharp peaks with controllable frequencies and amplitudes the spectral resolution is enhanced by using a second weak pulse with a 90 degrees phase shift so that the 1024 bits of information can be retrieved as a set of wellresolved pseudo2d spectra reproducing the input pattern novel active noisereducing headset using earshell vibration control active noisereducing anr headsets are available commercially in applications varying from aviation communication to consumer audio current anr systems use passive attenuation at high frequencies and loudspeakerbased active noise control at low frequencies to achieve broadband noise reduction this paper presents a novel anr headset in which the external noise transmitted to the users ear via earshell vibration is reduced by controlling the vibration of the earshell using force actuators acting against an inertial mass or the earshell headband modelbased theoretical analysis using velocity feedback control showed that current piezoelectric actuators provide sufficient force but require lower stiffness for improved lowfrequency performance control simulations based on experimental data from a laboratory headset showed that good performance can potentially be achieved in practice by a robust feedback controller while a singlefrequency realtime control experiment verified that noise reduction can be achieved using earshell vibration control theoretical and experimental investigations on coherence of traffic noise transmission through an open window into a rectangular room in highrise buildings a method for theoretically calculating the coherence between sound pressure inside a rectangular room in a highrise building and that outside the open window of the room is proposed the traffic noise transmitted into a room is generally dominated by lowfrequency components to which active noise control anc technology may find an application however good coherence between reference and error signals is essential for an effective noise reduction and should be checked first based on traffic noise prediction methods wave theory and mode coupling theory the results of this paper enabled one to determine the potentials and limitations of anc used to reduce such a transmission experimental coherence results are shown for two similar empty rectangular rooms located on the 17th and 30th floors of a 34 floor highrise building the calculated results with the proposed method are generally in good agreement with the experimental results and demonstrate the usefulness of the method for predicting the coherence highdensity remote storage the ohio state university libraries depository the article describes a highdensity offsite book storage facility operated by the ohio state university libraries opened in 1995 it has the capacity to house nearly 15 million items in only 9000 square feet by shelving books by size on 30foot tall shelving a sophisticated climate control system extends the life of stored materials up to 12 times an online catalog record for each item informs patrons that the item is located in a remote location regular courier deliveries from the storage facility bring requested materials to patrons with minimal delay hours of operation and service in academic libraries toward a national standard in an effort toward establishing a standard for academic library hours the article surveys and compares hours of operation and service for arl libraries and ipeds survey respondents the article ranks the arl association for research libraries libraries according to hours of operation and reference hours and then briefly discusses such issues as libraries offering twentyfour access and factors affecting service hour decisions using the web to answer legal reference questions in an effort to help nonlaw librarians with basic legal reference questions the author highlights three basic legal web sites and outlines useful subjectspecific web sites that focus on statutes and regulations case law and attorney directories the service side of systems librarianship describes the role of a systems librarian at a small academic library although online catalogs and the internet are making library accessibility more convenient the need for library buildings and professionals has not diminished typical duties of a systems librarian and the effects of new technology on librarianship are discussed services provided to other constituencies on campus and the blurring relationship between the library and computer services are also presented defining electronic librarianship a content analysis of job advertisements advances in technology create dramatic changes within libraries the complex issues surrounding this new electronic enduser environment have major ramifications and require expert knowledge electronic services librarians and electronic resources librarians are two specialized titles that have recently emerged within the field of librarianship to fill this niche job advertisements listed in american libraries from january 1989 to december 1998 were examined to identify responsibilities qualifications organizational and salary information relating to the newly emerging role of electronic librarian customer inreach and library strategic systems the case of illiad libraries have walls recognizing this fact the interlibrary loan department at virginia tech is creating systems and services that enable our customers to reach past our walls at anytime from anywhere customer inreach enables virginia tech faculty students and staff anywhere in the world to obtain information and services heretofore available only to our oncampus customers illiad virginia techs interlibrary borrowing system is the library strategic system that attains this goal the principles that guided development of illiad are widely applicable nuvox shows staying power with new cash new market who says you cant raise cash in todays telecom market nuvox communications positions itself for the long run with 785 million in funding and a new credit facility improvements and critique on sugenos and yasukawas qualitative modeling investigates sugenos and yasukawas 1993 qualitative fuzzy modeling approach we propose some easily implementable solutions for the unclear details of the original paper such as trapezoid approximation of membership functions rule creation from sample data points and selection of important variables we further suggest an improved parameter identification algorithm to be applied instead of the original one these details are crucial concerning the methods performance as it is shown in a comparative analysis and helps to improve the accuracy of the builtup model finally we propose a possible further rule base reduction which can be applied successfully in certain cases this improvement reduces the time requirement of the method by up to 16 in our experiments the plot thins thinclient computer systems and academic libraries the few libraries that have tried thin client architectures have noted a number of compelling reasons to do so for starters thin client devices are far less expensive than most pcs more importantly thin client computing devices are believed to be far less expensive to manage and support than traditional pcs academic libraries and community making the connection i explore the theme of academic libraries serving and reaching out to the broader community i highlight interesting projects reported on in the literature such as the through our parents eyes project and report on others i look at challenges to community partnerships and recommendations for making them succeed although i focus on links with the broader community i also took at methods for increasing cooperation among various units on campus so that the needs of campus community groupssuch as distance education students or disabled studentsare effectively addressed though academic libraries are my focus we can learn a lot from the community building efforts of public libraries using internet search engines to estimate word frequency the present research investigated internet search engines as a rapid costeffective alternative for estimating word frequencies frequency estimates for 382 words were obtained and compared across four methods 1 internet search engines 2 the kucera and francis 1967 analysis of a traditional linguistic corpus 3 the celex english linguistic database baayen et al 1995 and 4 participant ratings of familiarity the results showed that internet search engines produced frequency estimates that were highly consistent with those reported by kucera and francis and those calculated from celex highly consistent across search engines and very reliable over a 6 month period of time additional results suggested that internet search engines are an excellent option when traditional word frequency analyses do not contain the necessary data eg estimates for forenames and slang in contrast participants familiarity judgments did not correspond well with the more objective estimates of word frequency researchers are advised to use search engines with large databases eg altavista to ensure the greatest representativeness of the frequency estimates visualword identification thresholds for the 260 fragmented words of the snodgrass and vanderwart pictures in spanish word difficulty varies from language to language therefore normative data of verbal stimuli cannot be imported directly from another language we present mean identification thresholds for the 260 screenfragmented words corresponding to the total set of snodgrass and vanderwart 1980 pictures individual words were fragmented in eight levels using turbo pascal and the resulting program was implemented on a pc microcomputer the words were presented individually to a group of 40 spanish observers using a controlled time procedure an unspecific learning effect was found showing that performance improved due to practice with the task finally of the 11 psycholinguistic variables that previous researchers have shown to affect word identification only imagery accounted for a significant amount of variance in the threshold values a webaccessible database of characteristics of the 1945 basic japanese kanji in 1981 the japanese government published a list of the 1945 basic japanese kanji jooyoo kanjihyo including specifications of pronunciation this list was established as the standard for kanji usage in print the database for 1945 basic japanese kanji provides 30 cells that explain in detail the various characteristics of kanji means standard deviations distributions and information related to previous research concerning these kanji are provided in this paper the database is saved as a microsoft excel 2000 file for windows this kanji database is accessible on the web site of the oxford text archive oxford university httpotaahdsacuk using this database researchers and educators will be able to conduct planned experiments and organize classroom instruction on the basis of the known characteristics of selected kanji fullscreen ultrafast video modes overclocked by simple vesa routines and registers reprogramming under msdos fast fullscreen presentation of stimuli is necessary in psychological research although spitczok von brisinski 1994 introduced a method that achieved ultrafast display by reprogramming the registers he could not produce an acceptable fullscreen display in this report the author introduces a new method combining vesa routine calling with register reprogramming that can yield a display at 640  480 resolution with a refresh rate of about 150 hz measuring keyboard response delays by comparing keyboard and joystick inputs the response characteristics of pc keyboards have to be identified when they are used as response devices in psychological experiments in the past the proposed method has been to check the characteristics independently by means of external measurement equipment however with the availability of different pc models and the rapid pace of model change there is an urgent need for the development of convenient and accurate methods of checking the method proposed consists of raising the precision of the pcs clock to the microsecond level and using a joystick connected to the midi terminal of a sound board to give the pc an independent timing function statistical processing of the data provided by this method makes it possible to estimate accurately the keyboard scanning interval time and the average keyboard delay time the results showed that measured keyboard delay times varied from 11 to 73 msec depending on the keyboard model with most values being less than 30 msec computer program to generate operant schedules a computer program for programming schedules of reinforcement is described students can use the program to experience schedules of reinforcement that are typically used with nonhuman subjects accumulative recording of a students response can be shown on the screen andor printed with the computers printer the program can also be used to program operant schedules for animal subjects the program was tested with human subjects experiencing fixed ratio variable ratio fixed interval and variable interval schedules performance for

httpwwwgenpsylabunizhchwextorindexhtml adaptive neuralfuzzy control for interpolated nonlinear systems adaptive control for nonlinear timevarying systems is of both theoretical and practical importance we propose an adaptive control methodology for a class of nonlinear systems with a timevarying structure this class of systems is composed of interpolations of nonlinear subsystems which are inputoutput feedback linearizable both indirect and direct adaptive control methods are developed where the spatially localized models in the form of takagisugeno fuzzy systems or radial basis function neural networks are used as online approximators to learn the unknown dynamics of the system without assumptions on rate of change of system dynamics the proposed adaptive control methods guarantee that all internal signals of the system are bounded and the tracking error is asymptotically stable the performance of the adaptive controller is demonstrated using a jet engine control problem epsych interactive demonstrations and experiments in psychology epsych httpepsychmsstateedu a new web site currently under active development is intended to teach students about the discipline of psychology the site presumes little prior knowledge about the field and so may be used in introductory classes but it incorporates sufficient depth of coverage to be useful in more advanced classes as well numerous interactive and dynamic elements are incorporated into various modules orientations and guidebooks these elements include javabased experiments and demonstrations video clips and animated diagrams rapid access to all material is provided through a layerbased navigation system that allows users to visit various worlds of the mind active learning is encouraged by challenging students with puzzles and problems and by providing the opportunity to dig deeper to learn more about the phenomena at hand information architecture without internal theory an inductive design process this article suggests that information architecture ia design is primarily an inductive process although toplevel goals user attributes and available content are periodically considered the process involves bottomup design activities ia is inductive partly because it lacks internal theory and partly because it is an activity that supports emergent phenomena user experiences from basic design components the nature of ia design is well described by constructive induction ci a design process that involves locating the best representational framework for the design problem identifying a solution within that framework and translating it back to the design problem at hand the future of ia if it remains inductive or develops a body of theory or both is considered information architecture for the web the ia matrix approach to designing childrens portals the article presents a matrix that can serve as a tool for designing the information architecture of a web portal in a logical and systematic manner the information architect begins by inputting the portals objective target user and target content the matrix then determines the most appropriate information architecture attributes for the portal by filling in the applied information architecture portion of the matrix the article discusses how the matrix works using the example of a childrens web portal to provide access to museum information information architecture notes toward a new curriculum there are signs that information architecture is coalescing into a field of professional practice however if it is to become a profession it must develop a means of educating new information architects lessons from other fields suggest that professional education typically evolves along a predictable path from apprenticeships to trade schools to college and universitylevel education information architecture education may develop more quickly to meet the growing demands of the information society several pedagogical approaches employed in other fields may be adopted for information architecture education as long as the resulting curricula provide an interdisciplinary approach and balance instruction in technical and design skills with consideration of theoretical concepts key content areas are information organization graphic design computer science user and usability studies and communication certain logistics must be worked out including where information architecture studies should be housed and what kinds of degrees should be offered and at what levels the successful information architecture curriculum will be flexible and adaptable in order to meet the changing needs of students and the marketplace information architecture in jasist just where did we come from the emergence of information architecture within the information systems world has been simultaneously drawn out yet rapid those with an eye on history are quick to point to wurmans 1976 use of the term architecture of information but it has only been in the last 2 years that ia has become the source of sufficient interest for people to label themselves professionally as information architects the impetus for this recent emergence of ia can be traced to a historical summit supported by asist in may 2000 at boston it was here that several hundred of us gathered to thrash out the questions of just what ia was and what this new field might become at the time of the summit invited to present a short talk on my return journey from the annual acm sigchi conference i entered the summit expecting little and convinced that ia was nothing new i left 2 days later refreshed not just by the enthusiasm of the attendees for this term but by ias potential to unify the disparate perspectives and orientations of professionals from a range of disciplines it was at this summit that the idea for the special issue took root i proposed the idea to don kraft hoping he would find someone else to run with it as luck would have it i ended up taking charge of it myself with initial support from david blair from the suggestion to the finished producthas been the best part of 2 years and in that time more than 50 volunteers reviewed over 20 submissions the impact of the internet on public library use an analysis of the current consumer market for library and internet services the potential impact of the internet on the publics demand for the services and resources of public libraries is an issue of critical importance the research reported in this article provides baseline data concerning the evolving relationship between the publics use of the library and its use of the internet the authors developed a consumer model of the american adult market for information services and resources segmented by use or nonuse of the public library and by access or lack of access to and use or nonuse of the internet a national random digit dialing telephone survey collected data to estimate the size of each of six market segments and to describe their usage choices between the public library and the internet the analyses presented in this article provide estimates of the size and demographics of each of the market segments describe why people are currently using the public library and the internet identify the decision criteria people use in their choices of which provider to use identify areas in which libraries and the internet appear to be competing and areas in which they appear to be complementary and identify reasons why people choose not to use the public library andor the internet the data suggest that some differentiation between the library and the internet is taking place which may very well have an impact on consumer choices between the two longitudinal research is necessary to fully reveal trends in these usage choices which have implications for all types of libraries in planning and policy development duality revisited construction of fractional frequency distributions based on two dual lotka laws fractional frequency distributions of for example authors with a certain fractional number of papers are very irregular and therefore not easy to model or to explain the article gives a first attempt to this by as suming two simple lotka laws with exponent 2 one for the number of authors with n papers total count here and one for the number of papers with n authors n in n based on an earlier made convolution model of egghe interpreted and reworked now for discrete scores we are able to produce theoretical fractional frequency distributions with only one parameter which are in very close agreement with the practical ones as found in a large dataset produced earlier by rao 1995 the article also shows that irregular fractional frequency distributions are a consequence of lotkas law and are not examples of breakdowns of this famous historical law relevance of web documents ghosts consensus method the dominant method currently used to improve the quality of internet search systems is often called digital democracy such an approach implies the utilization of the majority opinion of internet users to determine the most relevant documents for example citation index usage for sorting of search results googlecom or an enrichment of a query with terms that are asked frequently in relation with the querys theme digital democracy is an effective instrument in many cases but it has an unavoidable shortcoming which is a matter of principle the average intellectual and cultural level of internet users is very low everyone knows what kind of information is dominant in internet query statistics therefore when one searches the internet by means of digital democracy systems one gets answers that reflect an underlying assumption that the users mind potential is very low and that his cultural interests are not demanding thus it is more correct to use the term digital ochlocracy to refer to internet search systems with digital democracy based on the wellknown mathematical mechanism of linear programming we propose a method to solve the indicated problem note on deterministic inventory lotsize models under inflation with shortages and deterioration for fluctuating demand by yang et al for original paper see hl yang et al ibid vol48 p14458 2001 yang et al extended the lotsize models to allow for inflation and fluctuating demand for this model they proved that the optimal replenishment schedule exists and is unique they also proposed an algorithm to find the optimal policy the present paper provides examples which show that the optimal replenishment schedule and consequently the overall optimal policy may not exist designing a screening experiment for highly reliable products within a reasonable lifetesting time how to improve the reliability of highly reliable products is one of the great challenges by using a resolution iii experiment together with degradation test tseng et al 1995 presented a case study of improving the reliability of fluorescent lamps however in conducting such an experiment they did not address the problem of how to choose the optimal settings of variables such as sample size inspection frequency and termination time for each run which are influential to the correct identification of significant factors and the experimental cost assuming that the products degradation paths satisfy wiener processes this paper proposes a systematic approach to the aforementioned problem first an identification rule is proposed next under the constraints of a minimum probability of correct decision and a maximum probability of incorrect decision of the proposed identification rule the optimum test plan can be obtained by minimizing the total experimental cost an example is provided to illustrate the proposed method analysis and efficient implementation of a linguistic fuzzy cmeans the paper is concerned with a linguistic fuzzy cmeans fcm algorithm with vectors of fuzzy numbers as inputs this algorithm is based on the extension principle and the decomposition theorem it turns out that using the extension principle to extend the capability of the standard membership update equation to deal with a linguistic vector has a huge computational complexity in order to cope with this problem an efficient method based on fuzzy arithmetic and optimization has been developed and analyzed we also carefully examine and prove that the algorithm behaves in a way similar to the fcm in the degenerate linguistic case synthetic data sets and the iris data set have been used to illustrate the behavior of this linguistic version of the fcm warranty reserves for nonstationary sales processes estimation of warranty costs in the event of product failure within the warranty period is of importance to the manufacturer costs associated with replacement or repair of the product are usually drawn from a warranty reserve fund created by the manufacturer considering a stochastic sales process first and second moments and thereby the variance are derived for the manufacturers total discounted warranty cost of a single sale for singlecomponent items under four different warranty policies from a manufacturers point of view these servicing strategies represent a renewable freereplacement nonrenewable freereplacement renewable prorata and a nonrenewable minimalrepair warranty plans the results are extended to determine the mean and variance of total discounted warranty costs for the total sales over the life cycle of the product furthermore using a normal approximation warranty reserves necessary for a certain protection level so that reserves are not completely depleted are found results and their managerial implications are studied through an extensive example a multimodal data collection tool using realbasic and mac os x this project uses realbasic 35 in the mac os x environment for development of a configuration tool that builds a data collection procedure for investigating the effectiveness of sonified graphs the advantage of using realbasic with the mac os x system is that it provides rapid development of stimulus presentation direct recording of data to files and control over other procedural issues the program can be made to run natively on the new mac os x system older mac os systems and windows 98se me 2000 pro with modification similar programs could be used to present any number of visualauditory stimulus combinations complete with questions for each stimulus toward an experimental timing standards lab benchmarking precision in the real world much discussion has taken place over the relative merits of various platforms and operating systems for realtime data collection most would agree that provided great care is taken many are capable of millisecond timing precision however to date much of this work has focused on the theoretical aspects of raw performance it is our belief that researchers would be better informed if they could place confidence limits on their own specific paradigms in situ and without modification to this end we have developed a millisecond precision test rig that can control and time experiments on a second presentation machine we report on the specialist hardware and software used we elucidate the importance of the approach in relation to realworld experimentation a serverside program for delivering experiments with animations a serverside program for animation experiments is presented the program is capable of delivering an experiment composed of discrete animation sequences in various file formats collecting a discrete or continuous response from the observer evaluating the appropriateness of the response and ensuring that the user is not proceeding at an unreasonable rate most parameters of the program are controllable by experimenteredited text files or simple switches in the program code thereby minimizing the need for programming to create new experiments a simple demonstration experiment is discussed and is freely available using netcloak to develop serverside webbased experiments without writing cgi programs serverside experiments use the web server rather than the participants browser to handle tasks such as random assignment eliminating inconsistencies with java and other clientside applications heretofore experimenters wishing to create serverside experiments have had to write programs to create common gateway interface cgi scripts in programming languages such as perl and c netcloak uses simple htmllike commands to create cgis we used netcloak to implement an experiment on probability estimation measurements of time on task and participants ip addresses assisted quality control without prior training in less than 1 month we were able to use netcloak to design and create a webbased experiment and to help graduate students create three webbased experiments of their own open courseware and shared knowledge in higher education most college and university campuses in the united states and much of the developed world today maintain one two or several learning management systems lmss which are courseware products that provide students and faculty with webbased tools to manage courserelated applications since the mid1990s two predominant models of web courseware management systems have emerged commercial and noncommercial some of the commercial products available today were created in academia as noncommercial but have since become commercially encumbered other products remain noncommercial but are struggling to survive in a world of fierce commercial competition this article argues for an ethics of pedagogy in higher education that would be based on the guiding assumptions of the nonproprietary peertopeer opensource software movement webbased experiments controlled by javascript an example from probability learning javascript programs can be used to control web experiments this technique is illustrated by an experiment that tested the effects of advice on performance in the classic probabilitylearning paradigm previous research reported that people tested via the web or in the lab tended to match the probabilities of their responses to the probabilities that those responses would be reinforced the optimal strategy however is to consistently choose the more frequent event probability matching produces suboptimal performance we investigated manipulations we reasoned should improve performance a horse race scenario in which participants predicted the winner in each of a series of races between two horses was compared with an abstract scenario used previously ten groups of learners received different amounts of advice including all combinations of 1 explicit instructions concerning the optimal strategy 2 explicit instructions concerning a monetary sum to maximize and 3 accurate information concerning the probabilities of events the results showed minimal effects of horse race versus abstract scenario both advice concerning the optimal strategy and probability information contributed significantly to performance in the task this paper includes a brief tutorial on javascript explaining with simple examples how to assemble a browserbased experiment using latent semantic analysis to assess reader strategies we tested a computerbased procedure for assessing reader strategies that was based on verbal protocols that utilized latent semantic analysis lsa students were given selfexplanationreading training sert which teaches strategies that facilitate selfexplanation during reading such as elaboration based on world knowledge and bridging between text sentences during a computerized version of sert practice students read texts and typed selfexplanations into a computer after each sentence the use of sert strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their selfexplanations this assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and lsa both human judgments and lsa were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with sert tended to paraphrase the text sentences whereas students who were compliant with sert tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context the similarity between human judgments and lsa indicates that lsa will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a webbased version of sert personality research on the internet a comparison of webbased and traditional instruments in takehome and inclass settings students faculty and researchers have become increasingly comfortable with the internet and many of them are interested in using the web to collect data few published studies have investigated the differences between webbased data and data collected with more traditional methods in order to investigate these potential differences two important factors were crossed in this study whether the data were collected on line or not and whether the data were collected in a group setting at a fixed time or individually at a time of the respondents choosing the visions of morality scale shelton and mcadams 1990 was used and the participants were assigned to one of four conditions inclass web survey inclass paperandpencil survey takehome web survey and takehome paperandpencil survey no significant differences in scores were found for any condition however response rates were affected by the type of survey administered with the takehome webbased instrument having the lowest response rate therefore researchers need to be aware that different modes of administration may affect subject attrition and may therefore confound investigations of other independent variables implications of documentlevel literacy skills for web site design the proliferation of world wide web web sites and the low cost of publishing information on the web have placed a tremendous amount of information at the fingertips of millions of people although most of this information is at least intended to be accurate there is much that is rumor innuendo urban legend and outright falsehood this raises problems especially for students of all ages trying to do research or learn about some topic finding accurate credible information requires document level literacy skills such as integration sourcing corroboration and search this paper discusses these skills and offers a list of simple ways that designers of educational web sites can help their visitors utilize these skills fuzzy control of multivariable process by modified error decoupling in this paper a control concept for the squared equal number of inputs and outputs multivariable process systems is given the proposed control system consists of two parts single loop fuzzy controllers in each loop and a centralized decoupling unit the fuzzy control system uses feedback control to minimize the error in the loop and the decoupler uses an adaptive technique to mitigate loop interactions the decoupler predicts the interacting loop changes and modifies the input error of the loop controller the controller was tested on the simulation model of single component vaporizer process improving computer security for authentication of users influence of proactive password restrictions entering a user namepassword combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems however it is a notoriously weak method in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack in an attempt to improve security proactive password checking may be used in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking in two experiments we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to log in the required length was a minimum of five characters in experiment i and eight characters in experiment 2 in both experiments one condition had only the length restriction and the other had additional restrictions the additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to log in for the fivecharacter passwords 75 were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed and this was reduced to 33 with the additional restrictions for the eightcharacter passwords 17 were cracked with no other restrictions and 125 with restrictions the results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed multidimensional data visualization historically data visualization has been limited primarily to two dimensions eg histograms or scatter plots available software packages eg data desk 61 matlab 61 sasjmp 404 spss 100 are capable of producing threedimensional scatter plots with varying degrees of user interactivity we constructed our own data visualization application with the visualization toolkit schroeder et al 1998 and tcltk to display multivariate data through the application of glyphs ware 2000 a glyph is a visual object onto which many data parameters may be mapped each with a different visual attribute eg size or color we used our multidimensional data viewer to explore data from several psycholinguistic experiments the graphical interface provides flexibility when users dynamically explore the multidimensional image rendered from raw experimental data we highlight advantages of multidimensional data visualization and consider some potential limitations fitting mixedeffects models for repeated ordinal outcomes with the nlmixed procedure this paper presents an analysis of repeated ordinal outcomes arising from two psychological studies the first case is a repeated measures analysis of variance the second is a mixedeffects regression in a longitudinal design in both the subjectspecific variation is modeled by including random effects in the linear predictor inside a link function of a generalized linear model the nlmixed procedure in sas is used to fit the mixedeffects models for the categorical response data the presentation emphasizes the parallel between the model specifications and the sas statements the purpose of this paper is to facilitate the use of mixedeffects models in the analysis of repeated ordinal outcomes teaching psychology as a laboratory science in the age of the internet for over 30 years psychologists have relied on computers to teach experimental psychology with the advent of experiment generators students can create welldesigned experiments and can test sophisticated hypotheses from the start of their undergraduate training characteristics of new netbased experiment generators are discussed and compared with traditional standalone generators a call is made to formally evaluate the instructional effectiveness of the wide range of experiment generators now available specifically software should be evaluated in terms of known learning outcomes using appropriate control groups the many inherent differences between any two software programs should be made clear the teachers instructional method should be fully described and held constant between comparisons finally the often complex interaction between the teachers instructional method and the pedagogical details of the software must be considered capturing

technique based on the correlation of wavelet features with the increasing importance of multiple multiplatform remote sensing missions fast and automatic integration of digital data from disparate sources has become critical to the success of these endeavors our work utilizes maxima of wavelet coefficients to form the basic features of a correlationbased automatic registration algorithm our waveletbased registration algorithm is tested successfully with data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and the landsat thematic mapper tm which differ by translation andor rotation by the choice of highfrequency wavelet features this method is similar to an edgebased correlation method but by exploiting the multiresolution nature of a wavelet decomposition our method achieves higher computational speeds for comparable accuracies this algorithm has been implemented on a singleinstruction multipledata simd massively parallel computer the maspar mp2 as well as on the crayt3d the cray t3e and a beowulf cluster of pentium workstations design of pidtype controllers using multiobjective genetic algorithms the design of a pid controller is a multiobjective problem a plant and a set of specifications to be satisfied are given the designer has to adjust the parameters of the pid controller such that the feedback interconnection of the plant and the controller satisfies the specifications these specifications are usually competitive and any acceptable solution requires a tradeoff among them an approach for adjusting the parameters of a pid controller based on multiobjective optimization and genetic algorithms is presented in this paper the mrcd multiobjective robust control design genetic algorithm has been employed the approach can be easily generalized to design multivariable coupled and decentralized pid loops and has been successfully validated for a large number of experimental cases temelin casts its shadow nuclear power plant reservations about temelin nuclear plant in the czech republic are political rather than technical this paper discusses the problems of turbogenerator vibrations and how they were diagnosed the paper also discusses some of the other problems of commissioning the power plant the simulator used for training new staff is also mentioned how should team captains order golfers on the final day of the ryder cup matches i used game theory to examine how team captains should select their slates for the final day of the ryder cup matches

projects support continuous improvement as the lessons gained from a crop of projects enable better teaching during the next course offering which in turn leads to better projects and further insights into teaching in search of strategic operations researchmanagement science we define strategic orms as orms work that leads to a sustainable competitive advantage we found evidence of strategic orms in the literature of strategic information systems sis and orms we examined 30 early examples of sis many of which contained orms work many of the most successful had high orms content while the least successful contained none the inclusion of orms work may be a key to sustaining an advantage from information technology we also examined the edelman prize finalist articles published between 1990 and 1999 we found that 13 of the 42 private sector applications meet our definition of strategic orms baseball optimization and the world wide web the competition for baseball playoff spotsthe fabled pennant raceis one of the most closely watched american sports traditions while playoff race statistics such as games back and magic number are informative they are overly conservative and do not account for the remaining schedule of games using optimization techniques one can model schedule effects explicitly and determine precisely when a team has secured a playoff spot or has been eliminated from contention the riot baseball playoff races web site developed at the university of california berkeley provides automatic updates of new optimizationbased playoff race statistics each day of the major league baseball season in developing the site we found that we could determine the firstplace elimination status of all teams in a division using a single linearprogramming formulation since a minimum win threshold for teams finishing in first place applies to all teams in a division we identified a similar but weaker result for the problem of playoff elimination with wildcard teams from revenue management concepts to software systems in 1999 after developing and installing over 170 revenue management rm systems for more than 70 airlines pros revenue management inc had the opportunity to develop rm systems for three companies in nonairline industries pros research and design department designed the opportunity analysis study oas a mix of orms consulting and software development practices to determine the applicability of rm in new business situations pros executed oass with the three companies in all three cases the oas supported the value of rm and led to contracts for implementation of rm systems lower bounds on the information rate of secret sharing schemes with homogeneous access structure we present some new lower bounds on the optimal information rate and on the optimal average information rate of secret sharing schemes with homogeneous access structure these bounds are found by using some covering constructions and a new parameter the kdegree of a participant that is introduced in this paper our bounds improve the previous ones in almost all cases a selfadjusting quality of service control scheme we propose and analyze a selfadjusting quality of service qos control scheme with the goal of optimizing the system reward as a result of servicing different priority clients with varying workload qos and rewardpenalty requirements our scheme is based on resource partitioning and designated degrade qos areas such that system resources are partitioned into priority areas each of which is reserved specifically to serve only clients in a corresponding class with no qos degradation plus one degraded qos area into which all clients can be admitted with qos adjustment being applied only to the lowest priority clients we show that the best partition is dictated by the workload and the rewardpenalty characteristics of clients in difference priority classes the analysis results can be used by a qos manager to optimize the system total reward dynamically in response to changing workloads at run time we demonstrate the validity of our scheme by means of simulation and comparing the proposed qos selfadjusting scheme with those that do not use resource partitioning or designated degraded qos areas fusion of qualitative bond graph and genetic algorithms a fault diagnosis application in this paper the problem of fault diagnosis via integration of genetic algorithms gas and qualitative bond graphs qbgs is addressed we suggest that gas can be used to search for possible fault components among a system of qualitative equations the qbg is adopted as the modeling scheme to generate a set of qualitative equations the qualitative bond graph provides a unified approach for modeling engineering systems in particular mechatronic systems in order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm we have tested the proposed algorithm on an inhouse designed and built floating disc experimental setup results from fault diagnosis in the floating disc system are presented and discussed additional measurements will be required to localize the fault when more than one fault candidate is inferred fault diagnosis is activated by a fault detection mechanism when a discrepancy between measured abnormal behavior and predicted system behavior is observed the fault detection mechanism is not presented here there is no optimal routing policy for the torus a routing policy is the method used to select a specific output channel for a message from among a number of acceptable output channels an optimal routing policy is a policy that maximizes the probability of a message reaching its destination without delays optimal routing policies have been proposed for several regular networks including the mesh and the hypercube an open problem in interconnection network research has been the identification of an optimal routing policy for the torus in this paper we show that there is no optimal routing policy for the torus our result is demonstrated by presenting a detailed example in which the best choice of output channel is dependent on the probability of each channel being available this result settles in the negative a conjecture by j wu 1996 concerning an optimal routing policy for the torus optimal online algorithm for scheduling on two identical machines with machine availability constraints this paper considers the online scheduling on two identical machines with machine availability constraints for minimizing makespan we assume that machine msub j is unavailable during period from ssub j to tsub j 0 or ssub j  tsub j j  1 2 and the unavailable periods of two machines do not overlap we show that the competitive ratio of list scheduling is 3 we further give an optimal algorithm with a competitive ratio 52 an efficient retrieval selection algorithm for video servers with random duplicated assignment storage technique random duplicated assignment rda is an approach in which video data is stored by assigning a number of copies of each data block to different randomly chosen disks it has been shown that this approach results in smaller response times and lower disk and ram costs compared to the wellknown disk stripping techniques based on this storage approach one has to determine for each given batch of data blocks from which disk each of the data blocks is to be retrieved this is to be done in such a way that the maximum load of the disks is minimized the problem is called the retrieval selection problem rsp in this paper we propose a new efficient algorithm for rsp this algorithm is based on the breadthfirst search approach and is able to guarantee optimal solutions for rsp in onsup 2mn where m and n correspond to the number of data blocks and the number of disks respectively we show that our proposed algorithm has a lower time complexity than an existing algorithm called the mfs algorithm edit distance of runlength encoded strings let x and y be two runlength encoded strings of encoded lengths k and l respectively we present a simple oxlyk time algorithm that computes their edit distance faulttolerant hamiltonian laceability of hypercubes it is known that every hypercube qsub n is a bipartite graph assume that nor2 and f is a subset of edges with forn2 we prove that there exists a hamiltonian path in qsub nf between any two vertices of different partite sets moreover there exists a path of length 2sup n2 between any two vertices of the same partite set assume that nor3 and f is a subset of edges with forn3 we prove that there exists a hamiltonian path in qsub nvf between any two vertices in the partite set without v furthermore all bounds are tight an identitybased society oriented signature scheme with anonymous signers in this paper we propose a new society oriented scheme based on the guillouquisquater 1989 signature scheme the scheme is identitybased and the signatures are verified with respect to only one identity that is the verifier does not have to know the identity of the cosigners but just that of the organization they represent operational phasespace probability distribution in quantum communication theory operational phasespace probability distributions are useful tools for describing quantum mechanical systems including quantum communication and quantum information processing systems it is shown that quantum communication channels with gaussian noise and quantum teleportation of continuous variables are described by operational phasespace probability distributions the relation of operational phasespace probability distribution to the extended phasespace formalism proposed by chountasis and vourdas 1998 is discussed embedding of levelcontinuous fuzzy sets on banach spaces in this paper we present an extension of the minkowski embedding theorem showing the existence of an isometric embedding between the classfsub cx of compactconvex and levelcontinuous fuzzy sets on a real separable banach space x and c0 1  bx the banach space of real continuous functions defined on the cartesian product between 0 1 and the unit ball bx in the dual space x also by using this embedding we give some applications to the characterization of relatively compact subsets of fsub cx in particular an ascoliarzela type theorem is proved and applied to solving the cauchy problem xt  ft xt xtsub 0  xsub 0 on fsub cx correlation of intuitionistic fuzzy sets by centroid method in this paper we propose a method to calculate the correlation coefficient of intuitionistic fuzzy sets by means of centroid this value obtained from our formula tell us not only the strength of relationship between the intuitionistic fuzzy sets but also whether the intuitionistic fuzzy sets are positively or negatively related this approach looks better than previous methods which only evaluate the strength of the relation furthermore we extend the centroid method to intervalvalued intuitionistic fuzzy sets the value of the correlation coefficient between intervalvalued intuitionistic fuzzy sets lies in the interval 1 1 as computed from our formula neighborhood operator systems and approximations this paper presents a framework for the study of generalizing the standard notion of equivalence relation in rough set approximation space with various categories of kstep neighborhood systems based on a binary relation on a finite universe six families of binary relations are obtained and the corresponding six classes of kstep neighborhood systems are derived extensions of pawlaks 1982 rough set approximation operators based on such neighborhood systems are proposed properties of neighborhood operator systems and rough set approximation operators are investigated and their connections are examined model predictive control helps to regulate slow processesrobust barrel temperature control slow temperature control is a challenging control problem the problem becomes even more challenging when multiple zones are involved such as in barrel temperature control for extruders often strict closedloop performance requirements such as fast startup with no overshoot and maintaining tight temperature control during production are given for such applications when characteristics of the system are examined it becomes clear that a commonly used proportional plus integral plus derivative pid controller cannot meet such performance specifications for this kind of system the system either will overshoot or not maintain the temperature within the specified range during the production run in order to achieve the required performance a control strategy that utilizes techniques such as model predictive control autotuning and multiple parameter pid is formulated this control strategy proves to be very effective in achieving the desired specifications and is very robust numerical representation of binary relations with a multiplicative error function this paper studies the case of the representation of a binary relation via a numerical function with threshold error depending on both compared alternatives the error is considered to be multiplicative its value being either directly or inversely proportional to the values of the numerical function for the first case it is proved that a binary relation is a semiorder moreover any semiorder can be represented in this form in the second case the corresponding binary relation is an interval order a pretopological approach for structural analysis the aim of this paper is to present a methodological approach for problems encountered in structural analysis this approach is based upon the pretopological concepts of pseudoclosure and minimal closed subsets the advantage of this approach is that it provides a framework which is general enough to model and formulate different types of connections that exist between the elements of a population in addition it has enabled us to develop a new structural analysis algorithm an explanation of the definitions and properties of the pretopological concepts applied in this work is first shown and illustrated in sample settings the structural analysis algorithm is then described and the results obtained in an economic study of the impact of geographic proximity on scientific collaborations are presented on batchconstructing bsup trees algorithm and its performance evaluation efficient construction of indexes is very important in bulkloading a database or adding a new index to an existing database since both of them should handle an enormous volume of data in this paper we propose an algorithm for batchconstructing the bsup tree the most widely used index structure in database systems the main characteristic of our algorithm is to simultaneously process all the key values to be placed on each btree page when accessing the page this avoids the overhead due to accessing the same page multiple times which results from applying the btree insertion algorithm repeatedly for performance evaluation we have analyzed our algorithm in terms of the number of disk accesses the results show that the number of disk accesses excluding those in the relocation process is identical to the number of pages belonging to the bsup tree considering that the relocation process is an unavoidable preprocessing step for batchconstructing of bsup trees our algorithm requires just one disk access per btree page and therefore turns out to be optimal we also present the performance tendency in relation with different parameter values via simulation finally we show the performance enhancement effect of our algorithm compared with the one using repeated insertions through experiments synthetic simultaneity  natural and artificial in control loops each element introduces time delays if those time delays are larger than the critical times for control of the system a problem exists i show a simple approach to mitigating this problem by basing the controllers decisions not on the observations themselves but on our projections as to what the observations will be at the time our controls reach the controlled system finally i argue that synthetic simultaneity explains libets 1993 results better than libets explanation maclp multi agent constraint logic programming multi agent systems mas have become the key technology for decomposing complex problems in order to solve them more efficiently or for problems distributed in nature however many industrial applications besides their distributed nature also involve a large number of parameters and constraints ie they are combinatorial solving such particularly hard problems efficiently requires programming tools that combine mas technology with a programming schema that facilitates the modeling and solution of constraints this paper presents maclp multi agent constraint logic programming a logic programming platform for building in a declarative way multi agent systems with constraintsolving capabilities maclp extends cspcons a logic programming system that permits distributed program execution through communicating sequential prolog processes with constraints by providing all the necessary facilities for communication between agents these facilities abstract from the programmer all the lowlevel details of the communication and allow him to focus on the development of the agent itself selforganizing feature maps predicting sea levels in this paper a new method for predicting sea levels employing selforganizing feature maps is introduced for that purpose the maps are transformed from an unsupervised learning procedure to a supervised one two concepts originally developed to solve the problems of convergence of other network types are proposed to be applied to kohonen networks a functional relationship between the number of neurons and the number of learning examples and a criterion to break off learning the latter one can be shown to be conform with the process of selforganization by using umatrices for visualization of the learning procedure the predictions made using these neural models are compared for accuracy with observations and with the prognoses prepared using six models two hydrodynamic models a statistical model a nearest neighbor model the persistence model and the verbal forecasts that are broadcast and kept on record by the sea level forecast service of the federal maritime and hydrography agency bsh in hamburg before training the maps the meteorological and oceanographic situation has to be condensed as well as possible and the weight and learning vectors have to be made as small as possible the selforganizing feature maps predict sea levels better than all six models of comparison selecting rail grade crossing investments with a decision support system the federal railroad administration fra has developed a series of rail and railrelated analysis tools that assist fra officials metropolitan planning organizations mpos state department of transportation dot and other constituents in evaluating the cost and benefits of potential infrastructure projects to meet agency objectives the fra wants to add a highspeed rail grade crossing analysis tool to its package of rail and railrelated intermodal software products this paper presents a conceptual decision support system dss that can assist officials in achieving this goal the paper first introduces the fras objectives and the role of cost benefit analysis in achieving these objectives next there is a discussion of the models needed to assess the feasibility of proposed highspeed rail grade crossing investments and the presentation of a decision support system dss that can deliver these models transparently to users then the paper illustrates a system session and examines the potential benefits from system use a study on meaning processing of dialogue with an example of development of travel consultation system this paper describes an approach to processing meaning instead of processing information in computing human intellectual activity is supported by linguistic activities in the brain therefore processing the meaning of language instead of processing information should allow us to realize human intelligence on a computer as an example of the proposed framework for processing meaning we build a travel consultation dialogue system which can understand utterance by a user and retrieve information through dialogue through a simulation example of the system we show that both information processing and language processing are integrated from a biological to a computational model for the autonomous behavior of an animat endowing an autonomous system like a robot with intelligent behavior is difficult for several reasons first behavior is such a wide topic that a general framework paradigm of inspiration must be chosen in order to obtain a consistent model such a framework can be for example biological modeling or an artificial intelligence approach second a general framework is not sufficient to determine a fully specified program to be implemented in a robot many choices tuning and tests must be carried out before obtaining a robust system a biological model is presented based on the definition of cortexlike automata representing elementary functions in the perceptive motor or associative domain these automata are connected in a network whose architecture functioning and learning rules are described in a cortical framework second the computational model derived from that biological model is specified the way units exchange and compute variables through links is explained with reference to corresponding biological elements it is then easier to report experiments allowing an autonomous system to learn regularities of a simple environment and to exploit them to satisfy some internal drives even if additional biological hints can be added this model allow us to better understand how a biological model can be implemented and how biological properties can emerge from a distributed set of units nissan v nissan trademark dispute is a trademark dispute a case of david v goliath or a corporation fending off a greedy opportunist this paper discusses the case of uzi nissan who is locked in a multimilliondollar legal battle over whether or not his use of the nissancom internet domain name infringes upon japans nissan motor cos trademark at the heart of the matter is the impact of the global internet on trademark law which traditionally has been strongly influenced by geographic considerations the paper discusses the background to the case from both sides and the issues involved design pid controllers for desired timedomain or frequencydomain response practical requirements on the design of control systems especially process control systems are usually specified in terms of timedomain response such as overshoot and rise time or frequencydomain response such as resonance peak and stability margin although numerous methods have been developed for the design of the proportionalintegralderivative pid controller little work has been done in relation to the quantitative timedomain and frequencydomain responses in this paper we study the following problem given a nominal stable process with time delay we design a suboptimal pid controller to achieve the required timedomain response or frequencydomain response for the nominal system or the uncertain system an hsub infinity  pid controller is developed based on optimal control theory and the parameters are derived analytically its properties are investigated and compared with that of two developed suboptimal controllers an hsub 2 pid controller and a maclaurin pid controller virtual borders real laws internet activity and treaties national governments are working to tame activity on the internet they have worked steadily to extend control over online activities that they believe affect their interests even when the activities occur outside their borders these usually involve what governments regard as their domain protecting public order enforcing commercial laws and occasionally protecting consumer interests methods have included assertions or legal jurisdiction based on where material is accessible instead of where it originates and the blocking of sites service providers or entire high level domains from access by citizens such instances are mentioned in this article whilst larger companies are able to defend themselves against overseas lawsuits individuals and smaller organizations lack the resources to defend what are often normal business activities at home but could violate the laws of local jurisdictions in countries around the world the problems of libel are discussed as are the blocking of certain sites by certain countries efforts to draw up internet treaties are also mentioned a better ballot box election officials are examining technologies to address a wide range of voting issues the problems observed in the november 2000 us election accelerated existing trends to get rid of lever machines punchcards and handcounted paper ballots and replace them with marksense balloting internet and automatic teller machine atm kiosk style computerbased systems an estimated us 24 billion will be spent in the united states and canada to update voting systems during the next decade voting online might enable citizens to vote even if they are unable to get to the polls yet making these methods work right turns out to be considerably more difficult than originally thought new electronic voting systems pose risks as well as solutions as it turns out many of the voting products currently for sale provide less accountability poorer reliability and greater opportunity for widespread fraud than those already in use this paper discusses the technology available and how to ensure accurate ballots putting pen to screen on tablet pcs

enough power to run the fullblown windows xp operating system in particular they will allow handwritten text to be entered onto a digitizing tablet and recognized a functionality thats called penbased computing the tablet pc will far outpace the computing power of existing small devices such as pdas personal digital assistants including those variants based on microsofts own pocket pc operating system horizontal waypoint guidance design using optimal control a horizontal waypoint guidance algorithm is proposed by applying linefollowing guidance to waypoint line segments in sequence the linefollowing guidance is designed using an lqr linear quadratic regulator then the optimal waypoint changing points are derived by minimizing the accelerations required for changing the waypoint line segments also derived is a sufficient condition for the stability bound of ground speed changes based on the lyapunov stability theorem simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively guide a vehicle along the sequence of waypoint line segments separation and tracking of multiple broadband sources with one electromagnetic vector sensor a structure for adaptively separating enhancing and tracking uncorrelated sources with an electromagnetic vector sensor emvs is presented the structure consists of a set of parallel spatial processors one for each individual source two stages of processing are involved in each spatial processor the first preprocessing stage rejects all other sources except the one of interest while the second stage is an adaptive one for maximizing the signaltonoise ratio snr and tracking the desired source the preprocessings are designed using the latest source parameter estimates obtained from the source trackers and a redesign is activated periodically or whenever any source has been detected by the source trackers to have made significant movement compared with conventional adaptive beamforming the algorithm has the advantage that no a priori information on any desired signal location is needed the sources are separated at maximum snr and their locations are available the structure is also well suited for parallel implementation numerical examples are included to illustrate the capability and performance of the algorithm recursive state estimation for multiple switching models with unknown transition probabilities this work considers hybrid systems with continuousvalued target states and discretevalued regime variable the changes switches of the regime variable are modeled by a finite state markov chain with unknown and random transition probabilities following dirichlet distributions our work analytically derives the marginal posterior distribution of the states and regime variables the transition probabilities being integrated out this leads to a variety of recursive hybrid state estimation schemes which are an appealing intuitive and straightforward extension of standard algorithms their performance is illustrated by a maneuvering target tracking example matlab code for plotting ambiguity functions a matlab code capable of plotting ambiguity functions of many different radar signals is presented the program makes use of matlabs sparse matrix operations and avoids loops the program could be useful as a pedagogical tool in radar courses teaching pulse compression incremental motion control of linear synchronous motor in this study a particular incremental motion control problem which is specified by the trapezoidal velocity profile using multisegment sliding mode control mssmc is proposed to control a permanent magnet linear synchronous motor pmlsm servo drive system first the structure and operating principle of the pmlsm are described in detail second a fieldoriented control pmlsm servo drive is introduced then each segment of the multisegment switching surfaces is designed to match the corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile thus the motor dynamics on the specifiedsegment switching surface have the desired velocity or acceleration corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile in addition the proposed control system is implemented in a pcbased computer control system finally the effectiveness of the proposed pmlsm servo drive system is demonstrated by some simulated and experimental results feedforward maximum power point tracking of pv systems using fuzzy controller a feedforward maximum power mp point tracking scheme is developed for the interleaved dual boost idb converter fed photovoltaic pv system using fuzzy controller the tracking algorithm changes the duty ratio of the converter such that the solar cell array sca voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the mp point at that solar insolation this is done by the feedforward loop which generates an error signal by comparing the instantaneous array voltage and reference voltage the reference voltage for the feedforward loop corresponding to the mp point is obtained by an offline trained neural network experimental data is used for offline training of the neural network which employs backpropagation algorithm the proposed fuzzy feedforward peak power tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through the simulation and experimental results and compared with the conventional proportional plus integral pi controller based system finally a comparative study of interleaved boost and conventional boost converter for the pv applications is given and their suitability is discussed a pid standard what why how the paper is written for all who develop and use pids it will aid in solving the long existing and continuing problem of confusing information on pids the acronym pid is widely understood to mean the principal document used to define the details of how a process works and how it is controlled the isa dictionary definition for pid tells what they do show the interconnection of process equipment and the instrumentation used to control the process in the process industry a standard set of symbols is used to prepare drawings of processes the instrument symbols used in these drawings are generally based on isas51 in the paper the isa standard is referred to as isa51 the article develops the concept of the standard and poses some of the questions that the standard can answer quantitative speed control for srm drive using fuzzy adapted inverse model quantitative and robust speed control for a switched reluctance motor srm drive is considered to be rather difficult and challenging owing to its highly nonlinear dynamic behavior a speed control scheme having twodegreeoffreedom 2dof structure is developed here to improve the speed dynamic response of an srm drive in the proposed control scheme the feedback controller is quantitatively designed to meet the desired regulation control requirements first then a reference model and a command feedforward controller based on an inverse plant model are employed to yield the desired tracking response at nominal case as the variations of system parameters and operating conditions occur the prescribed control specifications may not be satisfied any more to improve this the inverse model is adaptively tuned by a fuzzy control scheme so that the modelfollowing tracking error is significantly reduced in addition a simple disturbance cancellation robust controller is added to improve the tracking and regulation control performances further robust fuzzy controlled photovoltaic power inverter with taguchi method this paper presents design and implementation of a robust fuzzy controlled photovoltaic pv power inverter with taguchi tuned scaling factors to achieve fast transient response small steadystate error and system robustness a robust fuzzy controller is adopted in which its input and output scaling factors are determined efficiently by using the taguchituning algorithm the proposed system can operate in different modes gridconnection mode and standalone mode and can accommodate wide load variations simulation results and hardware measurements obtained from a prototype with a microcontroller intel 80196kc are presented to verify the theoretical discussions and its adaptivity robustness and feasibility robust wavelet neuro control for linear brushless motors design simulation and experimental implementation of a wavelet basis function network learning controller for linear brushless dc motors lbdcm are considered stability robustness with position tracking is the primary concern the proposed controller deals mainly with external disturbances eg nonlinear friction force and payload variation in motion control of linear motors it consists of two parts one is a state feedback component and the other one is a learning feedback component the state feedback controller is designed on the basis of a simple linear model and the learning feedback component is a wavelet neural controller the attenuation effect of wavelet neural networks on friction force is first verified by the numerical method the learning effect of wavelet neural networks on friction force is also shown in the numerical results then a wavelet neural network is applied on a real lbdcm to online suppress the friction force which may be variable due to the different lubrication the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes is demonstrated by simulated and experimental results outlier resistant adaptive matched filtering robust adaptive matched filtering amf whereby outlier data vectors are censored from the covariance matrix estimate is considered in a maximum likelihood estimation mle setting it is known that outlier data vectors whose steering vector is highly correlated with the desired steering vector can significantly degrade the performance of amf algorithms such as sample matrix inversion smi or fast maximum likelihood fml four new algorithms that censor outliers are presented which are derived via approximation to the mle solution two algorithms each are related to using the smi or the fml to estimate the unknown underlying covariance matrix results are presented using computer simulations which demonstrate the relative effectiveness of the four algorithms versus each other and also versus the smi and fml algorithms in the presence of outliers and no outliers it is shown that one of the censoring algorithms called the reiterative censored fast maximum likelihood cfml technique is significantly superior to the other three censoring methods in stressful outlier scenarios brightnessindependent startup routine for star trackers initial attitude acquisition by a modern star tracker is investigated here criteria for efficient organization of the onboard database are discussed with reference to a brightnessindependent initial acquisition algorithm star catalog generation preprocessing is described with emphasis on the identification of minimum star brightness for detection by a sensor based on a charge coupled device ccd photodetector this is a crucial step for proper evaluation of the attainable sky coverage when selecting the stars to be included in the onboard catalog test results are also reported both for reliability and accuracy even if the former is considered to be the primary target probability of erroneous solution is 02 in the case of single runs of the procedure while attitude determination accuracy is in the order of 002 degrees in the average for the computation of the inertial pointing of the boresight axis multiple model adaptive estimation with filter spawning multiple model adaptive estimation mmae with filter spawning is used to detect and estimate partial actuator failures on the vista f16 the truth model is a full sixdegreeoffreedom simulation provided by calspan and general dynamics the design models are chosen as 13state linearized models including first order actuator models actuator failures are incorporated into the truth model and design model assuming a failure to free stream filter spawning is used to include additional filters with partial actuator failure hypotheses into the mmae bank the spawned filters are based on varying degrees of partial failures in terms of effectiveness associated with the completeactuatonfailure hypothesis with the highest conditional probability of correctness at the current time thus a blended estimate of the failure effectiveness is found using the filters estimates based upon a nofailure hypothesis a complete actuator failure hypothesis and the spawned filters partialfailure hypotheses this yields substantial precision in effectiveness estimation compared with what is possible without spawning additional filters making partial failure adaptation a viable methodology matchedfilter template generation via spatial filtering application to fetal biomagnetic recordings we have developed a twostep procedure for signal processing of fetal biomagnetic recordings that removes cardiac interference and noise first a modified matched filter mf is applied to remove maternal cardiac interference then a simple signal space projection ssp is applied to remove noise the key difference between our mf and a conventional one is that the interference template and the template scaling are derived from a signal that has been spatially filtered to isolate the interference rather than from the raw signal unlike conventional mfs ours is able to separate maternal and fetal cardiac complexes even when they have similar morphology and overlap strongly when followed by a ssp that preserves only the signal subspace the noise is reduced to a low level design and implementation of a braincomputer interface with high transfer rates this paper presents a braincomputer interface bci that can help users to input phone numbers the system is based on the steadystate visual evoked potential ssvep twelve buttons illuminated at different rates were displayed on a computer monitor the buttons constituted a virtual telephone keypad representing the ten digits 09 backspace and enter users could input phone number by gazing at these buttons the frequencycoded ssvep was used to judge which button the user desired eight of the thirteen subjects succeeded in ringing the mobile phone using the system the average transfer rate over all subjects was 2715 bitsmin the attractive features of the system are noninvasive signal recording little training required for use and high information transfer rate approaches to improve the performance of the system are discussed noninvasive myocardial activation time imaging a novel inverse algorithm applied to clinical ecg mapping data linear approaches like the minimumnorm leastsquare algorithm show insufficient performance when it comes to estimating the activation time map on the surface of the heart from electrocardiographic ecg mapping data additional regularization has to be considered leading to a nonlinear problem formulation the gaussnewton approach is one of the standard mathematical tools capable of solving this kind of problem to our experience this algorithm has specific drawbacks which are caused by the applied regularization procedure in particular under clinical conditions the amount of regularization cannot be determined clearly for this reason we have developed an iterative algorithm solving this nonlinear problem by a sequence of regularized linear problems at each step of iteration an individual lcurve is computed subsequent iteration steps are performed with the individual optimal regularization parameter this novel approach is compared with the standard gaussnewton approach both methods are applied to simulated ecg mapping data as well as to single beat sinus rhythm data from two patients recorded in the catheter laboratory the proposed approach shows excellent numerical and computational performance even under clinical conditions at which the gaussnewton approach begins to break down bayesian nonstationary autoregressive models for biomedical signal analysis we describe a variational bayesian algorithm for the estimation of a multivariate autoregressive model with timevarying coefficients that adapt according to a linear dynamical system the algorithm allows for time and frequency domain characterization of nonstationary multivariate signals and is especially suited to the analysis of eventrelated data results are presented on synthetic data and real electroencephalogram data recorded in eventrelated desynchronization and photic synchronization scenarios supervisory control design based on hybrid systems and fuzzy events detection application to an oxichlorination reactor this paper presents a supervisory control scheme based on hybrid systems theory and fuzzy events detection the fuzzy event detector is a linguistic model which synthesizes complex relations between process variables and process events incorporating experts knowledge about the process operation this kind of detection allows the anticipation of appropriate control actions which depend upon the selected membership functions used to characterize the process under scrutiny the proposed supervisory control scheme was successfully implemented for an oxichlorination reactor in a vinyl monomer plant automated breath detection on longduration signals using feedforward backpropagation artificial neural networks a new breathdetection algorithm is presented intended to automate the analysis of respiratory data acquired during sleep the algorithm is based on two independent artificial neural networks annsub insp and annsub expi that recognize in the original signal windows of interest where the onset of inspiration and expiration occurs postprocessing consists in finding inside each of these windows of interest minimum and maximum corresponding to each inspiration and expiration the annsub insp and annsub expi correctly determine respectively 980 and 987 of the desired windows when compared with 29 820 inspirations and 29 819 expirations detected by a human expert obtained from three entirenight recordings postprocessing allowed determination of inspiration and expiration onsets with a mean difference with respect to the same human expert of mean or sd 34 or 71 ms for inspiration and 5 or 46 ms for expiration the method proved to be effective in detecting the onset of inspiration and expiration in full night continuous recordings a comparison of five human experts performing the same classification task yielded that the automated algorithm was undifferentiable from these human experts failing within the distribution of human expert results besides being applicable to adult respiratory volume data the presented algorithm was also successfully applied to infant sleep data consisting of uncalibrated rib cage and abdominal movement recordings a comparison with two previously published algorithms for breath detection in respiratory volume signal shows that the presented algorithm has a higher specificity while presenting similar or higher positive predictive values model selection in electromagnetic source analysis with an application to vefs in electromagnetic source analysis it is necessary to determine how many sources are required to describe the electroencephalogram or magnetoencephalogram adequately model selection procedures msps or goodness of fit procedures give an estimate of the required number of sources existing and new msps are evaluated in different source and noise settings two sources which are close or distant and noise which is uncorrelated or correlated the commonly used msp residual variance is seen to be ineffective that is it often selects too many sources alternatives like the adjusted hotellings test bayes information criterion and the wald test on source amplitudes are seen to be effective the adjusted hotellings test is recommended if a conservative approach is taken and msps such as bayes information criterion or the wald test on source amplitudes are recommended if a more liberal approach is desirable the msps are applied to empirical data visual evoked fields timevarying properties of renal autoregulatory mechanisms in order to assess the possible timevarying properties of renal autoregulation timefrequency and timescaling methods were applied to renal blood flow under broadband forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations and singlenephron renal blood flow with spontaneous oscillations obtained from normotensive spraguedawley wistar and longevans rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats timefrequency analyses of normotensive and hypertensive blood flow data obtained from either the whole kidney or the singlenephron show that indeed both the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback tgf mechanisms have timevarying characteristics furthermore we utilized the renyi entropy to measure the complexity of bloodflow dynamics in the timefrequency plane in an effort to discern differences between normotensive and hypertensive recordings we found a clear difference in renyi entropy between normotensive and hypertensive blood flow recordings at the whole kidney level for both forced p  0037 and spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations p  0033 and at the singlenephron level p  0008 especially at the singlenephron level the mean renyi entropy is significantly larger for hypertensive than normotensive rats suggesting more complex dynamics in the hypertensive condition to further evaluate whether or not the separation of dynamics between normotensive and hypertensive rats is found in the prescribed frequency ranges of the myogenic and tgf mechanisms we employed multiresolution wavelet transform our analysis revealed that exclusively over scale ranges corresponding to the frequency intervals of the myogenic and tgf mechanisms the widths of the blood flow wavelet coefficients fall into disjoint sets for normotensive and hypertensive rats the separation of the scales at the myogenic and tgf frequency ranges is distinct and obtained with 100 accuracy however this observation remains valid only for the whole kidney blood pressureflow data the results suggest that understanding of the timevarying properties of the two mechanisms is required for a complete description of renal autoregulation the use of the spsa method in ecg analysis the classification monitoring and compression of electrocardiogram ecg signals recorded of a single patient over a relatively long period of time is considered the particular application we have in mind is highresolution ecg analysis such as late potential analysis morphology changes in qrs during arrythmias twave alternants or the study of drug effects on ventricular activation we propose to apply a modification of a classical method of cluster analysis or vector quantization the novelty of our approach is that we use a new distortion measure to quantify the distance of two ecg cycles and the classdistortion measure is defined using a minmax criterion the new classdistortionmeasure is much more sensitive to outliers than the usual distortion measures using averagedistance the price of this practical advantage is that computational complexity is significantly increased the resulting nonsmooth optimization problem is solved by an adapted version of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation spsa method of j spall ieee trans automat contr vol 37 p 33241 mar 1992 the main idea is to generate a smooth approximation by a randomization procedure the viability of the method is demonstrated on both simulated and real data an experimental comparison with the widely used correlation method is given on real data model intestinal microflora in computer simulation a simulation and modeling package for hostmicroflora interactions the ecology of the human intestinal microflora and its interaction with the host are poorly understood though more and more data are being acquired in part using modern molecular methods development of a quantitative theory has not kept pace with this increase in observing power this is in part due to the complexity of the system and to the lack of simulation environments in which to test what the ecological effect of a hypothetical mechanism of interaction would be before resorting to laboratory experiments the mimics project attempts to address this through the development of a cellular automaton for simulation of the intestinal microflora in this paper the design and evaluation of this simulator is discussed conformalmapping design tools for coaxial couplers with complex cross section numerical conformal mapping is exploited as a simple accurate and efficient tool for the analysis and design of coaxial waveguides and couplers of complex cross section an implementation based on the schwarzchristoffel toolbox a publicdomain matlab package is applied to slotted coaxial cables and to symmetrical coaxial couplers with circular or polygonal inner conductors and external shields the effect of metallic diaphragms of arbitrary thickness partially separating the inner conductors is also easily taken into account the proposed technique is validated against the results of the finiteelement method showing excellent agreement at a fraction of the computational cost and is also extended to the case of nonsymmetrical couplers providing the designer with important additional degrees of freedom convolutionbased global simulation technique for millimeterwave photodetector and photomixer circuits a fast convolutionbased timedomain approach to global photoniccircuit simulation is presented that incorporates a physical device model in the complete detector or mixer circuit the device used in the demonstration of this technique is a gaas metalsemiconductormetal msm photodetector that offers a high response speed for the detection and generation of millimeter waves global simulation greatly increases the accuracy in evaluating the complete circuit performance because it accounts for the effects of the millimeterwave embedding circuit device and circuit performance are assessed by calculating optical responsivity and bandwidth deviceonly simulations using gaas msms are compared with global simulations that illustrate the strong interdependence between device and external circuit accurate modeling of lossy nonuniform transmission lines by using differential quadrature methods this paper discusses an efficient numerical approximation technique called the differential quadrature method dqm which has been adapted to model lossy uniform and nonuniform transmission lines the dqm can quickly compute the derivative of a function at any point within its bounded domain by estimating a weighted linear sum of values of the function at a small set of points belonging to the domain using the dqm the frequencydomain telegraphers partial differential equations for transmission lines can be discretized into a set of easily solvable algebraic equations dqm reduces interconnects into multiport models whose port voltages and currents are related by rational formulas in the frequency domain although the rationalization process in dqm is comparable with the pade approximation of asymptotic waveform evaluation awe applied to transmission lines the derivation mechanisms in these two disparate methods are significantly different unlike awe which employs a complex momentmatching process to obtain rational approximation the dqm requires no approximation of transcendental functions thereby avoiding the process of moment generation and moment matching due to global sampling of points in the dqm approximation it requires far fewer grid points in order to build accurate discrete models than other numerical methods do the dqmbased timedomain model can be readily integrated in a circuit simulator like spice an unconditionally stable extended use finiteelement timedomain solution of active nonlinear microwave circuits using perfectly matched layers this paper proposes an extension of the unconditionally stable finiteelement timedomain fetd method for the global electromagnetic analysis of active microwave circuits this formulation has two advantages first the timestep size is no longer governed by the spatial discretization of the mesh but rather by the nyquist sampling criterion second the implementation of the truncation by the perfectly matched layers pml is straightforward an anisotropic pml absorbing material is presented for the truncation of fetd lattices reflection less than 50 db is obtained numerically over the entire propagation bandwidth in waveguide and microstrip line a benchmark test on a microwave amplifier indicates that this extended fetd algorithm is not only superior to finitedifference timedomainbased algorithm in mesh flexibility and simulation accuracy but also reduces computation time dramatically lowvoltage dram sensing scheme with offsetcancellation sense amplifier a novel bitline sensing scheme is proposed for lowvoltage dram to achieve low power dissipation and compatibility with lowvoltage cmos one of the major obstacles in lowvoltage dram is the degradation of dataretention time due to low signal level at the memory cell which requires powerconsuming refresh operations more frequently this paper proposes an offsetcancellation senseamplifier scheme ocsa that improves dataretention time significantly even at low supply voltage it also improves die efficiency because the proposed scheme reduces the number of sense amplifiers by supporting more cells in each sense amplifier measurements show that the dataretention time of the proposed scheme at 15v supply voltage is 24 times of the conventional scheme at 20 v industry insiders loading up on cheap company stock a surge of telecom executives and directors purchasing their own companies stock in the last two months points toward a renewed optimism in the beleaguered sector say some observers who view the rash of insider buying as a vote of confidence from management airgate pcs charter communications cox communications crown castle international nextel communications and nortel networks all have seen infusions of insider investment this summer echoing trends in both the telecom industry and the national economy new tuning method for pid controller in this paper a tuning method for proportionalintegralderivative pid controller and the performance assessment formulas for this method are proposed this tuning method is based on a genetic algorithm based pid controller design method for deriving the tuning formula the genetic algorithm based design method is applied to design pid controllers for a variety of processes the relationship between the controller parameters and the parameters that characterize the process dynamics are determined and the tuning formula is then derived using simulation studies the rules for assessing the performance of a pid controller tuned by the proposed method are also given this makes it possible to incorporate the capability to determine if the pid controller is well tuned or not into an autotuner an autotuner based on this new tuning method and the corresponding performance assessment rules is also established simulations and realtime experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of these formulas a 120mw 3d rendering engine with 6mb

results show that the switching scheme provides 11b resolution at 100 msampless and 6b at 1 gsampless the degradation in signaltonoise ratio is not observed for the variation of the supply voltage down to 15 v which means the proposed scheme is suitable for lowvoltage applications fast frequency acquisition phasefrequency detectors for gsampless phaselocked loops this paper describes two techniques for designing phasefrequency detectors pfds with higher operating frequencies periods of less than 8 the delay of a fanout4 inverter fo4 and faster frequency acquisition prototypes designed in 025 mu m cmos process exhibit operating frequencies of 125 ghz 18fo4 and 15 ghz 167fo4 for two techniques respectively whereas a conventional pfd operates at 1 ghz 110fo4 the two proposed pfds achieve a capture range of 17 and 14 the conventional design respectively highvoltage transistor scaling circuit techniques for highdensity negativegate channelerasing nor flash memories in order to scale highvoltage transistors for highdensity negativegate channelerasing nor flash memories two circuit techniques were developed a proposed level shifter with low operating voltage is composed of three parts a latch holding the negative erasing voltage two coupling capacitors connected with the latched nodes in the latch and highvoltage drivers inverting the latch resulting in reduction of the maximum internal voltage by 05 v a proposed highvoltage generator adds a pathgate logic to a conventional highvoltage generator to realize both low noise and low ripple voltage resulting in a reduction of the maximum internal voltage by 05 v as a result these circuit techniques along with high couplingratio cell technology can scale down the highvoltage transistors by 15 and can realize

compilers get most of the attention but there are others the regex class in the systemtextregularexpressions namespace has the ability to compile favorite regular expressions into a net assembly in fact the net common language runtime clr contains a whole namespace full of classes to help us build assemblies define types and emit their implementations all at run time these classes which comprise the systemreflectionemit namespace are known collectively as reflection emit net obfuscation and intellectual property the author considers obfuscation options for protecting net code many programs wont need obfuscation because the loss caused by reverse engineering will be nonexistent numerous obfuscators are already available for the net platform ranging from a basic renaming obfuscator to a fully functional obfuscator that handles mixed ilnative code assemblies created in any managed language including microsofts c with managed extensions an obfuscator simply makes your application harder to reverse engineer it does not prevent reverse engineering however the cost of obfuscation is insignificant when compared to the cost of a typical software development project if you feel like an obfuscator provides you any benefit at all its probably worth the price controller performance analysis with lqg benchmark obtained under closed loop conditions this paper proposes a new method for obtaining a linear quadratic gaussian lqg benchmark in terms of the variances of process input and output from closedloop data for assessing the controller performance lqg benchmark has been proposed in the literature to assess controller performance since the lqg tradeoff curve represents the limit of performance in terms of input and output variances however an explicit parametric model is required to calculate the lqg benchmark in this work we propose a data driven subspace approach to calculate the lqg benchmark under closedloop conditions with certain external excitations the optimal lqgbenchmark variances are obtained directly from the subspace matrices corresponding to the deterministic inputs and the stochastic inputs which are identified using closedloop data with setpoint excitation these variances are used for assessing the controller performance the method proposed in this paper is applicable to both univariate and multivariate systems profit analysis for the implementation of feedforward control to the existing feedbackonly control system is also analyzed under the optimal lqg performance framework lossy spice models produce realistic averaged simulations

prospective teachers enrolling in a computers in education course participated in the study for a whole semester results from the study provided substantial evidence supporting emails beneficial effects on student attitudes toward the instructor and other classmates polarization of the rf field in a human head at high field a study with a quadrature surface coil at 70 t the rf field intensity distribution in the human brain becomes inhomogeneous due to wave behavior at high field this is further complicated by the spatial distribution of rf field polarization that must be considered to predict image intensity distribution an additional layer of complexity is involved when a quadrature coil is used for transmission and reception to study such complicated rf field behavior a computer modeling method was employed to investigate the rf field of a quadrature surface coil at 300 mhz theoretical and experimental results for a phantom and the human head at 70 t are presented the results are theoretically important and practically useful for highfield quadrature coil design and application perfusion quantification using gaussian process deconvolution the quantification of perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast mri dscmri requires deconvolution to obtain the residual impulse response function irf in this work a method using the gaussian process for deconvolution gpd is proposed the fact that the irf is smooth is incorporated as a constraint in the method the gpd method which automatically estimates the noise level in each voxel has the advantage that model parameters are optimized automatically the gpd is compared to singular value decomposition svd using a common threshold for the singular values and to svd using a threshold optimized according to the noise level in each voxel the comparison is carried out using artificial data as well as data from healthy volunteers it is shown that gpd is comparable to svd with a variable optimized threshold when determining the maximum of the irf which is directly related to the perfusion gpd provides a better estimate of the entire irf as the signaltonoise ratio snr increases or the time resolution of the measurements increases gpd is shown to be superior to svd this is also found for large distribution volumes controls help harmonic spray do ok removing residues looks at how innovative wafercleaning

with a range of ratios matching ventilation and perfusion this mri vq technique is completely noninvasive and does not involve ionized radiation a limitation of this method is the nonsimultaneous

the vr treatment was more effective than the traditional cognitivebehavioral psychonutritional groups in improving the overall psychological state of the patients in particular the therapy was more effective in improving body satisfaction selfefficacy and motivation for change no significant differences were found in the reduction of the binge eating behavior the possibility of inducing a significant change in body image and its associated behaviors using a vrbased shortterm therapy can be useful to improve the body satisfaction in traditional weight reduction programs however given the nature of this research that does not include a followup study the obtained results are preliminary only the treatment of fear of flying a controlled study of imaginal and virtual reality graded exposure therapy the goal of this study was to determine if virtual reality graded exposure therapy vrget was equally efficacious more efficacious or less efficacious than imaginal exposure therapy in the treatment of fear of flying thirty participants age398or97 with confirmed dsmiv diagnosis of specific phobia fear of flying were randomly assigned to one of three groups vrget with no physiological feedback vrgetno vrget with physiological feedback vrgetpm or systematic desensitization with imaginal exposure therapy iet eight sessions were conducted once a week during each session physiology was measured to give an objective measurement of improvement over the course of exposure therapy in addition selfreport questionnaires subjective ratings of anxiety suds and behavioral observations included here as flying behavior before beginning treatment and at a threemonth posttreatment followup were included in the analysis of results the chisquare test of behavioral observations based on a threemonth posttreatment followup revealed a statistically significant difference in flying behavior between the groups  chi sup 241941 p0001 only one participant 10 who received iet eight of the ten participants 80 who received vrgetno and ten out of the ten participants 100 who received vrgetpm reported an ability to fly without medication or alcohol at threemonth followup although this study included small sample sizes for the three groups the results showed vrget was more effective than iet in the treatment of flying it also suggests that physiological feedback may add to the efficacy of vr treatment the development of virtual reality therapy vrt system for the treatment of acrophobia and therapeutic case virtual reality therapy vrt based on this sophisticated technology has been used in the treatment of subjects diagnosed with acrophobia a disorder that is characterized by marked anxiety upon exposure to heights and avoidance of heights conventional vr systems for the treatment of acrophobia have limitations overcostly devices or somewhat unrealistic graphic scenes the goal of this study was to develop an inexpensive and more realistic virtual environment ve in which to perform exposure therapy for acrophobia it is based on a personal computer and a virtual scene of a bungejump tower in the middle of a large city the virtual scenario includes an open lift surrounded by props beside a tower which allows the patient to feel a sense of heights the effectiveness of the ve was evaluated through the clinical treatment of a subject who was suffering from the fear of heights as a result it was proved that this vr environment was effective and realistic at overcoming acrophobia according not only to the comparison results of a variety of questionnaires before and after treatment but also to the subjects comments that the ve seemed to evoke more fearful feelings than the real situation virtual reality treatment of flying phobia flying phobia fp might become a very incapacitating and disturbing problem in a persons social working and private areas psychological interventions based on exposure therapy have proved to be effective but given the particular nature of this disorder they bear important limitations exposure therapy for fp might be excessively costly in terms of time money and efforts virtual reality vr overcomes these difficulties as different significant environments might be created where the patient can interact with what he or she fears while in a totally safe and protected environment the therapists consulting room this paper intends on one hand to show the different scenarios designed by our team for the vr treatment of fp and on the other to present the first results supporting the effectiveness of this new tool for the treatment of fp in a multiple baseline study interaction and presence in the clinical relationship virtual reality vr as communicative medium between patient and therapist the great potential offered by virtual reality vr to clinical psychologists derives prevalently from the central role in psychotherapy occupied by the imagination and by memory these two elements which are fundamental in our life present absolute and relative limits to the individual potential using vr as an advanced imaginal system an experience that is able to reduce the gap existing between imagination and reality it is possible to transcend these limits in this sense vr can improve the efficacy of a psychological therapy for its capability of reducing the distinction between the computers reality and the conventional reality two are the core characteristics of this synthetic imaginal experience the perceptual illusion of nonmediation and the possibility of building and sharing a common ground in this sense experiencing presence in a clinical virtual environment ve such as a shared virtual hospital requires more than reproduction of the physical features of external reality it requires the creation and sharing of the cultural web that makes meaningful and therefore visible both people and objects populating the environment the paper outlines a framework for supporting the development and tuning of clinically oriented vr systems realtime quasi2d inversion of array resistivity logging data using neural network we present a quasi2d realtime inversion algorithm for a modern galvanic array tool via dimensional reduction and neural network simulation using reciprocity and superposition we apply a numerical focusing technique to the unfocused data the numerically focused data are much less subject to 2d and layering effects and can be approximated as from a cylindrical 1d earth we then perform 1d inversion on the focused data to provide approximate information about the 2d resistivity structure a neural network is used to perform forward modeling in the 1d inversion which is several hundred times faster than conventional numerical forward solutions testing our inversion algorithm on both synthetic and field data shows that this fast inversion algorithm is useful for providing formation resistivity information at a

boom period in the late nineties the air conditioning market finds itself in something of a lull at present but manufacturers arent panicking access privilege management in protection systems we consider the problem of managing access privileges on protected objects we associate one or more locks with each object one lock for each access right defined by the object type possession of an access right on a given object is certified by possession of a key for this object if this key matches one of the object locks we introduce a number of variants to this basic keylock technique polymorphic access rights make it possible to decrease the number of keys required to certify possession of complex access privileges that are defined in terms of several access rights multiple locks on the same access right allow us to exercise forms of selective revocation of access privileges a lock conversion function can be used to reduce the number of locks associated with any given object to a single lock the extent of the results obtained is evaluated in relation to alternative methodologies for access privilege management anatomy of the coupling query in a web warehouse to populate a data warehouse specifically designed for web data ie web warehouse it is imperative to harness relevant documents from the web in this paper we describe a query mechanism called coupling query to glean relevant web data in the context of our web warehousing system called warehouse of web data whoweda a coupling query may be used for querying both html and xml documents important features of our query mechanism are the ability to query metadata content internal and external hyperlink structure of web documents based on partial knowledge ability to express constraints on tag attributes and tagless segment of data ability to express conjunctive as well as disjunctive query conditions compactly ability to control execution of a web query and preservation of the topological structure of hyperlinked documents in the query results we also discuss how to formulate a query graphically and in textual form using a coupling graph and coupling text respectively application of traditional system design techniques to web site design after several decades of computer program construction there emerged a set of principles that provided guidance to produce more manageable programs with the emergence of the plethora of internet web sites one wonders if similar guidelines are followed in their construction since this is a new technology no apparent universally accepted methods have emerged to guide the designer in web site construction this paper reviews the traditional principles of structured programming and the preferred characteristics of web sites finally a mapping of how the traditional guidelines may be applied to web site construction is presented the application of the traditional principles of structured programming to the design of a web site can provide a more usable site for the visitors to the site the additional benefit of using these timehonored techniques is the creation of a web site that will be easier to maintain by the development staff a scalable and lightweight qos monitoring technique combining passive and active approaches on the mathematical formulation of compact monitor to make a scalable and lightweight qos monitoring system we 2002 have proposed a new qos monitoring technique called the changeofmeasure based passiveactive monitoring compact monitor which is based on the changeofmeasure framework and is an active measurement transformed by using passively monitored data this technique enables us to measure detailed qos information for individual users applications and organizations in a scalable and lightweight manner in this paper we present the mathematical foundation of compact monitor in addition we show its characteristics through simulations in terms of typical implementation issues for inferring the delay distributions the results show that compact monitor gives accurate qos estimations with only a small amount of extra traffic for active measurement computing transient gating charge movement of voltagedependent ion channels the opening of voltagegated sodium potassium and calcium ion channels has a steep relationship with voltage in response to changes in the transmembrane voltage structural movements of an ion channel that precede channel opening generate a capacitative gating current the net gating charge displacement due to membrane depolarization is an index of the voltage sensitivity of the ion channel activation process understanding the molecular basis of voltagedependent gating of ion channels requires the measurement and computation of the gating charge q we derive a simple and accurate semianalytic approach to computing the voltage dependence of transient gating charge movement qv relationship of discrete markov state models of ion channels using matrix methods this approach allows rapid computation of qv curves for finite and infinite length step depolarizations and is consistent with experimentally measured transient gating charge this computational approach was applied to shaker potassium channel gating including the impact of inactivating particles on potassium channel gating currents coarsegrained reduction and analysis of a network model of cortical response i drifting grating stimuli we present a reduction of a largescale network model of visual cortex developed by mclaughlin shapley shelley and wielaard the reduction is from many integrateandfire neurons to a spatially coarsegrained system for firing rates of neuronal subpopulations it accounts explicitly for spatially varying architecture ordered cortical maps such as orientation preference that vary regularly across the cortical layer and disordered cortical maps such as spatial phase preference or stochastic input conductances that may vary widely from cortical neuron to cortical neuron the result of the reduction is a set of nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations for phaseaveraged firing rates of neuronal subpopulations across the model cortex derived asymptotically from the full model without the addition of any extra phenomological constants this reduced system is used to study the response of the model to drifting grating stimuli  where it is shown to be useful for numerical investigations that reproduce at far less computational cost the salient features of the pointneuron network and for analytical investigations that unveil cortical mechanisms behind the responses observed in the simulations of the largescale computational model for example the reduced equations clearly show 1 phase averaging as the source of the timeinvariance of corticocortical conductances 2 the mechanisms in the model for higher firing rates and better orientation selectivity of simple cells which are near pinwheel centers 3 the effects of the lengthscales of corticocortical coupling and 4 the role of noise in improving the contrast invariance of orientation selectivity noise and the psth response to current transients ii integrateandfire model with slow recovery and application to motoneuron data for pti see ibid vol11 no2  p135151 2001 a generalized version of the integrateandfire model is presented that qualitatively reproduces firing rates and membrane trajectories of motoneurons the description is based on the spikeresponse model and includes three different time constants the passive membrane time constant a recovery time of the input conductance after each spike and a time constant of the spike afterpotential the effect of stochastic background input on the peristimulus time histogram psth response to spike input is calculated analytically model results are compared with the experimental data of poliakov et al 1996 the linearized theory shows that the psth response to an input spike is proportional to a filtered version of the postsynaptic potential generated by the input spike the shape of the filter depends on the background activity the full nonlinear theory is in close agreement with simulated psth data os porting and application development for soc to deliver improved usability in highend portable consumer products the use of an appropriate consumer operating system os is becoming far more widespread using a commercially supported os also vastly increases the availability of supported applications for the device developer this trend adds major complexity to the problem of system implementation porting a complete operating system to a new hardware design adds significantly to the development burden increasing both timetomarket and expense even for those familiar with the integration of a realtime os the porting validation and support of a complex platform os is a formidable task is open source more or less secure networks dominate todays computing landscape and commercial technical protection is lagging behind attack technology as a result protection programme success depends more on prudent management decisions than on the selection of technical safeguards the paper takes a management view of protection and seeks to reconcile the need for security with the limitations of technology new thinking on rendering looks at how graphics hardware solves a range of rendering problems citizen centric identity management chip tricks accelerating and harmonizing the diffusion and acceptance of electronic services in europe in a secure and practical way has

implementation and transition to a new cryptographic benchmark cryptography is the science of coding information to create unintelligible ciphers that conceal or hide messages the process that achieves this goal is commonly referred to as encryption although encryption processes of various forms have been employed for centuries to protect the exchange of messages the advent of the information age has underscored the importance of strong cryptography as a process to secure data exchanged through electronic means and has accentuated the demand for products offering these services this article describes the process that has led to the development of the latest cryptographic benchmark the advanced encryption standard aes the article briefly examines the requirements set forth

intrusion detection systems intrusion detection systems ids can play a very valuable role in the defence of a network however it is important to understand not just what it will do and how it does it  but what it wont do and why this article does not go into the technical working of ids in too much detail rather it limits itself to a discussion of some of the capabilities and failings of the technology development of a computeraided manufacturing system for profiled edge lamination tooling profiled edge lamination pel tooling is a promising rapid tooling rt method involving the assembly of an array of laminations whose top edges are simultaneously profiled and beveled based on a cad model of the intended tool surface to facilitate adoption of this rt method by industry a comprehensive pel tooling development system is proposed the two main parts of this system are 1 iterative tool design based on thermal and structural models and 2 fabrication of the tool using a computeraided manufacturing cam software and abrasive water jet cutting cam software has been developed to take lamination slice data profiles from any proprietary rp software in the form of polylines and create smooth kinematically desirable cutting trajectories for each tool lamination two cutting trajectory algorithms called identical equidistant profile segmentation and adaptively vector profiles projection avpp were created for this purpose by comparing the performance of both algorithms with a benchmark part shape the avpp algorithm provided better cutting trajectories for complicated tool geometries a 15layer aluminum pel tool was successfully fabricated using a 5axis cnc awj cutter and nc code generated by the cam software control of thin film growth in chemical vapor deposition manufacturing systems a feasibility study a study is carried out to design and optimize chemical vapor deposition cvd systems for material fabrication design and optimization of the cvd process is necessary to satisfying strong global demand and ever increasing quality requirements for thin film production advantages of computer aided optimization include high design turnaround time flexibility to explore a larger design space and the development and adaptation of automation techniques for design and optimization a cvd reactor consisting of a vertical impinging jet at atmospheric pressure for growing titanium nitride films is studied for thin film deposition numerical modeling and simulation are used to determine the rate of deposition and film uniformity over a wide range of design variables and operating conditions these results are used for system design and optimization the optimization procedure employs an objective function characterizing film quality productivity and operational costs based on reactor gas flow rate susceptor temperature and precursor concentration parameter space mappings are used to determine the design space while a minimization algorithm such as the steepest descent method is used to determine optimal operating conditions for the system the main features of computer aided design and optimization using these techniques are discussed in detail sensing and control of doublesided arc welding process the welding industry is driven to improve productivity without sacrificing quality for thick material welding the current practice is to use backing or multiple passes the laser welding process capable of achieving deep narrow penetration can significantly improve welding productivity for such applications by reducing the number of passes however its competitiveness in comparison with traditional arc welding is weakened by its high cost strict fitup requirement and difficulty in welding large structures in this work a different method referred to as doublesided arc welding dsaw is developed to improve the arc concentration for arc welding a sensing and control system is developed to achieve deep narrow penetration under variations in welding conditions experiments verified that the pulsed keyhole dsaw system developed is capable of achieving deep narrow penetration on a 12 inch thick square butt joint in a single pass hidden markov modelbased tool wear monitoring in turning this paper presents a new modeling framework for tool wear monitoring in machining processes using hidden markov models hmms feature vectors are extracted from vibration signals measured during turning a codebook is designed and used for vector quantization to convert the feature vectors into a symbol sequence for the hidden markov model a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach for different lengths of training data and observation sequence experimental results show that successful tool state detection rates as high as 97 can be achieved by using this approach modeling cutting temperatures for turning inserts with various tool geometries and materials temperatures are of interest in machining because cutting tools often fail by thermal softening or temperatureactivated wear many models for cutting temperatures have been developed but these models consider only simple tool geometries such as a rectangular slab with a sharp corner this report describes a finite element study of tool temperatures in cutting that accounts for tool nose radius and included angle effects a temperature correction factor model that can be used in the design and selection of inserts is developed to account for these effects a parametric mesh generator is used to generate the finite element models of tool and inserts of varying geometries the steadystate temperature response is calculated using nastran solver several finite element analysis fea runs are performed to quantify the effects of inserts included angle nose radius and materials for the insert and the tool holder on the cutting temperature at the insert rake face the fea results are then utilized to develop a temperature correction factor model that accounts for these effects the temperature correction factor model is integrated with an analytical temperature model for rectangular inserts to predict cutting temperatures for contour turning with inserts of various shapes and nose radii finally experimental measurements of cutting temperature using the toolwork thermocouple technique are performed and compared with the predictions of the new temperature model the comparisons show good agreement application of an internally consistent material model to determine the effect of tool edge geometry in orthogonal machining it is well known that the edge geometry of a cutting tool affects the forces measured in metal cutting two experimental methods have been suggested in the past to extract the ploughing noncutting component from the total measured force 1 the extrapolation approach and 2 the dwell force technique this study reports the behavior of zinc during orthogonal machining using tools of controlled edge radius applications of both the extrapolation and dwell approaches show that neither produces an analysis that yields a material response consistent with the known behavior of zinc further analysis shows that the edge geometry modifies the shear zone of the material and thereby modifies the forces when analyzed this way the measured force data yield the expected material response without requiring recourse to an additional ploughing component speaker adaptive modeling by vocal tract normalization this paper presents methods for speaker adaptive modeling using vocal tract normalization vtn along with experimental tests on three databases we propose a new training method for vtn by using singledensity acoustic models per hmm state for selecting the scale factor of the frequency axis we avoid the problem that a mixturedensity tends to learn the scale factors of the training speakers and thus cannot be used for selecting the scale factor we show that using single gaussian densities for selecting the scale factor in training results in lower error rates than using mixture densities for the recognition phase we propose an improvement of the wellknown twopass strategy by using a nonnormalized acoustic model for the first recognition pass instead of a normalized model lower error rates are obtained in recognition tests this method is compared with a fast variant of vtn the twopass strategy is an efficient method but it is suboptimal because the scale factor and the word sequence are determined sequentially we found that for telephone digit string recognition this suboptimality reduces the vtn gain in recognition performance by 30 relative in summary on the german spontaneous speech task verbmobil the wsj task and the german telephone digit string corpus sietill the proposed methods for vtn reduce the error rates significantly prediction and compensation of dynamic errors for coordinate measuring machines coordinate measuring machines cmms are already widely utilized as measuring tools in the modem manufacturing industry rapidly approaching now is the trend for nextgeneration cmms however the increases in measuring velocity of cmm applications are limited by dynamic errors that occur in cmms in this paper a systematic approach for modeling the dynamic errors of a touchtrigger probe cmm is developed through theoretical analysis and experimental study an overall analysis of the dynamic errors of cmms is conducted with weak components of the cmm identified by a laser interferometer the probing process as conducted with a touchtrigger probe is analyzed the dynamic errors are measured modeled and predicted using neural networks the results indicate that using this mode it is possible to compensate for the dynamic errors of cmms control of transient thermal response during sequential opendie forging a trajectory optimization approach a trajectory optimization approach is applied to the design of a sequence of opendie forging operations in order to control the transient thermal response of a large titanium alloy billet the amount of time the billet is soaked in furnace prior to each successive forging operation is optimized to minimize the total process time while simultaneously satisfying constraints on the maximum and minimum values of the billet temperature distribution to avoid microstructural defects during forging the results indicate that a differential heating profile is the most effective at meeting these design goals characterization of sheet buckling subjected to controlled boundary constraints a wedge strip test is designed to study the onset and postbuckling behavior of a sheet under various boundary constraints the device can be easily incorporated into a conventional tensile test machine and material resistance to buckling is measured as the buckling height versus the inplane strain state the design yields different but consistent buckling modes with easy changes of boundary conditions either clamped or freed and sample geometry experimental results are then used to verify a hybrid approach to buckling prediction ie the combination of the fem analysis and an energybased analytical wrinkling criterion the fem analysis is used to obtain the stress field and deformed geometry in a complex forming condition while the analytical solution is to provide the predictions less sensitive to artificial numerical parameters a good agreement between experimental data and numerical predictions is obtained ecggated sup 18ffdg positron emission tomography single

metabolic pet with data from other imaging techniques is always hampered by some transfer uncertainty and scatter we wanted to evaluate a new fourierbased ecggated pet technique using a high resolution scanner providing both metabolic and functional data with respect to feasibility in patients with diseased left ventricles fortyfive patients with coronary artery disease and at least one left ventricular segment with severe hypokinesis or akinesis at biplane cineventriculography were included a new fourierbased ecggated metabolic sup 18ffdgpet was performed in these patients function

artefacts or testtotest variability the results indicate the presence of considerable amounts of viable myocardium in regions with an uptake of 4050 sup 18ffdg a novel approach for the detection of pathlines in xray angiograms the wavefront propagation algorithm presents a new pathline approach based on the wavefront propagation principle and developed in order to reduce the variability in the outcomes of the quantitative coronary artery analysis this novel approach called wavepath reduces the influence of the userdefined start and endpoints of the vessel segment and is therefore more robust and improves the reproducibility of the lesion quantification substantially the validation study shows that the wavepath method is totally constant in the middle part of the pathline even when using the method for constructing a bifurcation or sidebranch pathline furthermore the number of corrections needed to guide the wavepath through the correct vessel is decreased from an average of 044 corrections per pathline to an average of 012 per pathline therefore it can be concluded that the wavepath algorithm improves the overall analysis substantially a new voltagevector selection algorithm in direct torque control of induction motor drives ac drives based on direct torque control of induction machines allow high dynamic performance to be obtained with very simple control schemes the drive behavior in terms of current flux and torque ripple is dependent on the utilised voltage vector selection strategy and the operating conditions in this paper a new voltage vector selection algorithm which allows a sensible reduction of the rms value of the stator current ripple without increasing the average value of the inverter switching frequency and without the need of a pwm pulse generator block is presented numerical simulations have been carried out to validate the proposed method application of sugeno fuzzylogic controller to the stator fieldoriented doublyfed asynchronous motor drive this study deals with the application of the fuzzycontrol theory to woundrotor asynchronous motor with both its stator and rotor fed by two pwm voltagesource inverters in which the system operates in stator fieldoriented control thus after determining the model of the machine we present two types of fuzzy controller mamdani and sugeno controllers the training of the last one is carried out starting from the first simulation study is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method a robust hsub infinity  control approach for induction motors this paper deals with the robustness and stability of an induction motor control structure against internal and external disturbances in the proposed control scheme we have used an hsub infinity  controller with field orientation and inputoutput linearization to achieve the abovespecified features simulation results are included to illustrate the control approach performances new approach to standing phase angle reduction for power system restoration during power system restoration it is necessary to check the phase angle between two buses before closing circuit breakers to connect a line between them these angles may occur across a tie line between two systems or between two connected subsystems within a system in case of large standing phase angle spa difference the synchrocheck relay does not allow closing of the breaker for this line therefore this excessive spa has to be reduced before attempting to connect the line in this paper a new and fast method for reducing spa is presented for this purpose the standing phase angle difference between two specific buses is represented in terms of sensitivity factors associated with the change in active power generations and consumption at the buses then the proposed method reschedule generation of selected units or shed load of selected buses to reduce excessive spa difference between two buses based on sensitivity factors steinmetz system design under unbalanced conditions this paper studies and develops general analytical expressions to obtain threephase current symmetrization under unbalanced voltage conditions it proposes two procedures for this symmetrization the application of the traditional expressions assuming symmetry conditions and the use of optimization methods based on the general analytical equations specifically the paper applies and evaluates these methods to analyze the steinmetz system design several graphics evaluating the error introduced by assumption of balanced voltage in the design are plotted and an example is studied to compare both procedures in the example the necessity to apply the optimization techniques in highly unbalanced conditions is demonstrated robust speech recognition using probabilistic union models this paper introduces a new statistical approach namely the probabilistic union model for speech recognition involving partial unknown frequencyband corruption partial frequencyband corruption accounts for the effect of a family of realworld noises previous methods based on the missing feature theory usually require the identity of the noisy bands this identification can be difficult for unexpected noise with unknown timevarying band characteristics the new model combines the local frequencyband information based on the union of random events to reduce the dependence of the model on information about the noise this model partially accomplishes the target offering robustness to partial frequencyband corruption while requiring no information about the noise this paper introduces the theory and implementation of the union model and is focused on several important advances these new developments include a new algorithm for automatic order selection a generalization of the modeling principle to accommodate partial feature stream corruption and a combination of the union model with conventional noise reduction techniques to deal with a mixture of stationary noise and unknown nonstationary noise for the evaluation we used the tidigits database for speakerindependent connected digit recognition the utterances were corrupted by various types of additive noise stationary or timevarying assuming no knowledge about the noise characteristics the results indicate that the new model offers significantly improved robustness in comparison to other models a genetic approach to the optimization of automatic generation control parameters for power systems this paper presents a method based on genetic algorithm for the automatic generation control of power systems the technique is applied to control a system which includes two areas tied together through a power line as a consequence of continuous load variation the frequency of the power system changes with time in conventional studies frequency transients are minimized by using integral controllers and thus zero steadystate error is obtained in this paper integral controller gains and frequency bias factors are determined by using the genetic algorithm the results of simulation reveal the application of the genetic algorithm having easy implementation to find the global optimum values of the control parameters successive expansion method of network planning applying symbolic analysis method the conventional power system network successive expansion planning method is discussed in the context of the new paradigm of competitive electric power energy and service market in sequel the paper presents an application of the conceptually new computer program based on the symbolic analysis of load flows in power system networks the network parameters and variables are defined as symbols the symbolic analyzer which models analytically the power system dc load flows enables the sensitivity analysis of the power system to parameter and variable variations costs transfers injections a valuable tool for the expansion planning analysis that virtue could not be found within the conventional approach relying on compensation methods precalculated distribution factors and so on this novel application sheds some light on the traditional power system network expansion planning method as well as on its possible application within the system network expansion planning in the new environment assuming the competitive electric power market optimal estimation of a finite sample of a discrete chaotic process the synthesis of optimal algorithms for estimating discrete chaotic processes specified by a finite sample is considered various possible approaches are discussed expressions determining the potential accuracy in estimating a single value of the chaotic process are derived an example of the application of the general equations obtained is given neural networks in optimal filtration the combined use and mutual influence of neural networks and optimal filtering is considered the neuralnetwork and filtering approaches are compared by solving two simple optimalfiltering problems linear filtering and the filtering of a binary telegraph signal corresponding to observations in discrete white noise hybrid fuzzy modeling of chemical processes fuzzy models have been proved to have the ability of modeling all plants without any priori information however the performance of conventional fuzzy models can be very poor in the case of insufficient training data due to their poor extrapolation capacity in order to overcome this problem a hybrid greybox fuzzy modeling approach is proposed in this paper to combine expert experience local linear models and historical data into a uniform framework it consists of two layers the expert fuzzy model constructed from linguistic information the local linear model and the ts type fuzzy model constructed from data are all put in the first layer layer 2 is a fuzzy decision module that is used to decide which model in the first layer should be employed to make the final prediction the output of the second layer is the output of the hybrid fuzzy model with the help of the linguistic information the poor extrapolation capacity problem caused by sparse training data for conventional fuzzy models can be overcome simulation result for ph neutralization process demonstrates its modeling ability over the linear models the expert fuzzy model and the conventional fuzzy model fuzzy system modeling in pharmacology an improved algorithm in this paper we propose an improved fuzzy system modeling algorithm to address some of the limitations of the existing approaches identified during our modeling with pharmacological data this algorithm differs from the existing ones in its approach to the cluster validity problem ie number of clusters the projection schema ie input membership assignment and rule determination and significant input determination the new algorithm is compared with the bazoonturksen model which is based on the wellknown sugenoyasukawa approach the comparison was made in terms of predictive performance using two different data sets the first comparison was with a two variable nonlinear function prediction problem and the second comparison was with a clinical pharmacokinetic modeling problem it is shown that the proposed algorithm provides more precise predictions determining the degree of significance for each input variable allows the user to distinguish their relative importance a strategy for a payoffswitching differential game based on fuzzy reasoning in this paper a new concept of a payoffswitching differential game is introduced in this new game any one player at any time may have several choices of payoffs for the future moreover the payoffswitching process including the time of payoff switching and the outcome payoff of any one player is unknown to the other indeed the overall payoff which is a sequence of several payoffs is unknown until the game ends an algorithm for determining a reasoning strategy based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed in this algorithm the fuzzy theory is used to estimate the behavior of one player during a past time interval by deriving two fuzzy matrices gsm game similarity matrix and vgsm variation of gsm the behavior of the player can be quantified two weighting vectors are selected to weight the relative importance of the players behavior at each past time instant finally a simple fuzzy inference rule is adopted to generate a linear reasoning strategy the advantage of this algorithm is that it provides a flexible way for differential game specialists to convert their knowledge into a reasonable strategy a practical example of guarding three territories is given to illustrate our main ideas an improved selforganizing cpnbased fuzzy system with adaptive backpropagation algorithm this paper describes an improved selforganizing cpnbased counterpropagation network fuzzy system two selforganizing algorithms iusocpn and issocpn being unsupervised and supervised respectively are introduced the idea is to construct the neuralfuzzy system with a twophase hybrid learning algorithm which utilizes a cpnbased nearestneighbor clustering scheme for both structure learning and initial parameters setting and a gradient descent method with adaptive learning rate for fine tuning the parameters the obtained network can be used in the same way as a cpn to model and control dynamic systems while it has a faster learning speed than the original backpropagation algorithm the comparative results on the examples suggest that the method is fairly efficient in terms of simple structure fast learning speed and relatively high modeling accuracy an accurate cog defuzzifier design using lamarckian coadaptation of learning and evolution this paper proposes a design technique of optimal center of gravity cog defuzzifier using the lamarckian coadaptation of learning and evolution the proposed cog defuzzifier is specified by various design parameters such as the centers widths and modifiers of mfs the design parameters are adjusted with the lamarckian coadaptation of learning and evolution where the learning performs a local search of design parameters in an individual cog defuzzifier but the evolution performs a global search of design parameters among a population of various cog defuzzifiers this coadaptation scheme allows to evolve much faster than the nonlearning case and gives a higher possibility of finding an optimal solution due to its wider searching capability an application to the truck backerupper control problem of the proposed coadaptive design method of cog defuzzifier is presented the approximation ability and control performance are compared with those of the conventionally simplified cog defuzzifier in terms of the fuzzy logic controllers approximation error and the average tracing distance respectively hierarchical neurofuzzy quadtree models hybrid neurofuzzy systems have been in evidence during the past few years due to its attractive combination of the learning capacity of artificial neural networks with the interpretability of the fuzzy systems this article proposes a new hybrid neurofuzzy model named hierarchical neurofuzzy quadtree hnfq which is based on a recursive partitioning method of the input space named quadtree the article describes the architecture of this new model presenting its basic cell and its learning algorithm the hnfq system is evaluated in three well known benchmark applications the sincx y function approximation the mackey glass chaotic series forecast and the two spirals problem when compared to other neurofuzzy systems the hnfq exhibits competing results with two major advantages it automatically creates its own structure and it is not limited to few input variables efficient tracking of the crosscorrelation coefficient in many audio processing algorithms involving manipulation of discretetime signals the performance can vary strongly over the repertoire that is used this may be the case when the signals from the various channels are allowed to be strongly positively or negatively correlated we propose and analyze a general formula for tracking the timedependent correlation between two signals some special cases of this formula lead to classical results known from the literature others are new this formula is recursive in nature and uses only the instantaneous values of the two signals in a lowcost and lowcomplexity manner in particular there is no need to take square roots or to carry out divisions furthermore this formula can be modified with respect to the occurrence of the two signals so as to further decrease the complexity and increase ease of implementation the latter modification comes at the expense that not the actual correlation is tracked but rather a somewhat deformed version of it to overcome this problem we propose for a number of instances of the tracking formula a simple warping operation on the deformed correlation now we obtain at least for sinusoidal signals the correct value of the correlation coefficient special attention is paid to the convergence behavior of the algorithm for stationary signals and the dynamic behavior if there is a transition to another stationary state the latter is considered to be important to study the tracking abilities to nonstationary signals we illustrate tracking algorithm by using it for stereo music fragments obtained from a number of digital audio recordings universal approximation by hierarchical fuzzy system with constraints on the fuzzy rule this paper presents a special hierarchical fuzzy system where the outputs of the previous layer are not used in the ifparts but used only in the thenparts of the fuzzy rules of the current layer the proposed scheme can be shown to be a universal approximator to any continuous function on a compact set if complete fuzzy sets are used in the ifparts of the fuzzy rules with singleton fuzzifier and center average defuzzifier from the simulation of ball and beam control system it is demonstrated that the proposed scheme approximates with good accuracy the model nonlinear controller with fewer fuzzy rules than the centralized fuzzy system and its control performance is comparable to that of the nonlinear controller approximation theory of fuzzy systems based upon genuine manyvalued implications  mimo cases it is constructively proved that the multiinputmultioutput fuzzy systems based upon genuine manyvalued implications are universal approximators they are called boolean type fuzzy systems in this paper the general approach to construct such fuzzy systems is given that is through the partition of the output region by the given accuracy two examples are provided to demonstrate the way in which fuzzy systems are designed to approximate given functions with a given required approximation accuracy approximation theory of fuzzy systems based upon genuine manyvalued implications  siso cases it is proved that the single input and single output siso fuzzy systems based upon genuine manyvalued implications are universal approximators it is shown theoretically that fuzzy control systems based upon genuine manyvalued implications are equivalent to those based upon tnorm implications the general approach to construct fuzzy systems is given it is also shown that defuzzifier based upon center of areas is not appropriate to the fuzzy systems based upon genuine manyvalued implications fuzzy systems with overlapping gaussian concepts approximation properties in sobolev norms in this paper the approximating capabilities of fuzzy systems with overlapping gaussian concepts are considered the target function is assumed to be sampled either on a regular gird or according to a uniform probability density by exploiting a connection with radial basis functions approximators a new method for the computation of the system coefficients is provided showing that it guarantees uniform approximation of the derivatives of the target function improved analysis for the nonlinear performance of cmos current mirrors with device mismatch the nonlinear performance of the simple and complementary mosfet current mirrors are analyzed closedform expressions are obtained for the harmonic and intermodulation components resulting from a multisinusoidal input current these expressions

currently operate perceptual audio coding using adaptive pre and postfilters and lossless compression this paper proposes a versatile perceptual audio coding method that achieves high compression ratios and is capable of low encodingdecoding delay it accommodates a variety of source signals including both music and speech with different sampling rates it is based on separating irrelevance and redundancy reductions into independent functional units this contrasts traditional audio coding where both are integrated within the same subband decomposition the separation allows for the independent optimization of the irrelevance and redundancy reduction units for both reductions we rely on adaptive filtering and predictive coding as much as possible to minimize the delay a psychoacoustically controlled adaptive linear filter is used for the irrelevance reduction and the redundancy reduction is carried out by a predictive lossless coding scheme which is termed weighted cascaded least mean squared wclms method experiments are carried out on a database of moderate size which contains monosignals of different sampling rates and varying nature music speech or mixed they show that the proposed wclms lossless coder outperforms other competing lossless coders in terms of compression ratios and delay as applied to the prefiltered signal moreover a subjective listening test of the combined prefilterlossless coder and a stateoftheart perceptual audio coder pac shows that the new method achieves a comparable compression ratio and audio quality with a lower delay

engineering functions and create an interactive model of its distribution system in the early 1990s it had used milsofts da software for more than 10 years to make engineering studies and had a landis and gyr scada system and a hybrid load management system for controlling water heater switches with the development of gis and facilities management fm applications svec decided this should be the basis for an information system that would model its physical plant and interface with its accounting and billing systems it could add applications such as outage management staking line design and metering to use this information and interface with these databases however based on svecs size it was not feasible to implement a sophisticated and expensive gisfm system over the past nine years svec has had success with a building block approach and its customers and employees are realizing the benefits of the automated applications this building block approach is discussed in this article including the gis outage management system mapviewer and a staking package the lessons learned and future expansion are discussed how closely can a personal computer clock track the utc timescale via

textindependent speaker identification we propose a formalism called vector filtering of spectral trajectories that allows the integration of a number of speech parameterization approaches cepstral analysis delta and delta delta parameterizations autoregressive vector modeling  under a common formalism we then propose a new filtering called contextual principal components cpc or timefrequency principal components tfpc this filtering consists in extracting the principal components of the contextual covariance matrix which is the covariance matrix of a sequence of vectors expanded by their context we apply this new filtering in the framework of closedset speaker identification using a subset of the polycost database when using speakerdependent tfpc filters our results show a relative improvement of approximately 20 compared to the use of the classical cepstral coefficients augmented by their delta coefficients which is significantly better with a 90 confidence level agc for autonomous power system using combined intelligent techniques in the present work two intelligent load frequency controllers have been developed to regulate the power output and system frequency by controlling the speed of the generator with the help of fuel rack position control the first controller is obtained using fuzzy logic fl only whereas the second one by using a combination of fl genetic algorithms and neural networks the aim of the proposed controllers is to restore in a very smooth way the frequency to its nominal value in the shortest time possible whenever there is any change in the load demand etc the action of these controllers provides a satisfactory balance between frequency overshoot and transient oscillations with zero steadystate error the design and performance evaluation of the proposed controllers structure are illustrated with the help of case studies applied without loss of generality to a typical singlearea power system it is found that the proposed controllers exhibit satisfactory overall dynamic performance and overcome the possible drawbacks associated with other competing techniques intelligent optimal sieving method for facts device control in multimachine systems a multitarget oriented optimal control strategy for facts devices installed in multimachine power systems is presented in this paper which is named the intelligent optimal sieving control iosc method this new method divides the facts device output region into several parts and selects one typical value from each part which is called output candidate then an intelligent optimal sieve is constructed which predicts the impacts of each output candidate on a power system and sieves out an optimal output from all of the candidates the artificial neural network technologies and fuzzy methods are applied to build the intelligent sieve finally the real control signal of facts devices is calculated according to the selected optimal output through inverse system method simulation has been done on a threemachine power system and the results show that the proposed iosc controller can effectively attenuate system oscillations and enhance the power system transient stability analysis and operation of hybrid active filter for harmonic elimination this paper presents a hybrid active filter topology and its control to suppress the harmonic currents from entering the power source the adopted hybrid active filter consists of one active filter and one passive filter connected in series by controlling the equivalent output voltage of active filter the harmonic currents generated by the nonlinear load are blocked and flowed into the passive filter the power rating of the converter is reduced compared with the pure active filters to filter the harmonic currents the harmonic current detecting approach and dclink voltage regulation are proposed to obtain equivalent voltage of active filter the effectiveness of the adopted topology and control

energizing of utility capacitors is presented  the analysis is tested on a system consisting of 13 buses and is representative of a mediumsized industrial plant finally each kind of electrical disturbance is analyzed with examples representing each tool a qualitative comparison of results shows the advantages and drawbacks of each signal processing technique applied to power quality

largescale power network into the desired number of connected subnetworks with quasibalanced fse burdens and minimum frontier elements after partitioning a distributed intelligent system based on radial basis function neural network rbf nn and companion fuzzy system is suggested for fse the relevant theoretical analysis and procedure are presented in the paper the proposed distributed intelligent fse method has been implemented with sparse storage technique and tested on the ieee 14 30 and 118bus systems respectively computer simulation results show that the proposed fse method

future trend estimation of trifocal tensor using gmm a novel estimation of a trifocal tensor based on the gaussian mixture model gmm is presented the mixture model is built assuming that the residuals of inliers and outliers belong to different gaussian distributions the bayesian rule is then employed to detect the inliers for reestimation experiments show that the presented method is more precise and relatively unaffected by outliers blind source separation applied to image cryptosystems with dual encryption blind source separation bss is explored to add another encryption level besides the existing encryption methods for image cryptosystems the transmitted images are covered with a noise image by specific mixing before encryption and then recovered through bss after decryption simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed method waveletbased image segment representation an efficient representation method for arbitrarily shaped image segments is proposed this method includes a smart way to select a wavelet basis to approximate the given image segment with improved image quality and reduced computational load textindependent speaker verification using utterance level scoring and covariance modeling this paper describes a computationally simple method to perform text independent speaker verification using second order statistics the suggested method called utterance level scoring uls allows one to obtain a normalized score using a single pass through the frames of the tested utterance the utterance sample covariance is first calculated and then compared to the speaker covariance using a distortion measure subsequently a distortion measure between the utterance covariance and the sample covariance of data taken from different speakers is used to normalize the score experimental results from the 2000 nist speaker recognition evaluation are presented for uls used with different distortion measures and for a gaussian mixture model gmm system the results indicate that uls as a viable alternative to gmm whenever the computational complexity and verification accuracy needs to be traded adaptive image enhancement for retinal blood vessel segmentation retinal blood vessel images are enhanced by removing the nonstationary background which is adaptively estimated based on local neighbourhood information the result is a much better segmentation of the blood vessels with a simple algorithm and without the need to obtain a priori illumination knowledge of the imaging system mpeg4 video objectbased rate allocation with variable temporal rates in objectbased coding bit allocation is performed at the object level and temporal rates of different objects may vary the proposed algorithm deals with these two issues when coding

queensland and as controlled by the queensland office of gaming regulation qogr httpwwwqogrqldgovaukenoshtml the recurrences for the house net hold are derived and it is seen that these are piecewise linear with a ternary domain split and further the split points are stochastic in nature since this structure is intractable brockett and levine statistics  probability  their applications cbs college

specified hold for the inverse problem has been achieved to within 01 in all cases of interest to date a hybrid mlem algorithm for calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in semiparametric shared frailty models this paper describes a generalised hybrid mlem algorithm for the calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in semiparametric shared frailty models the cox proportional hazard models with hazard functions multiplied by a parametric frailty random variable this hybrid method is much faster than the standard em method and faster than the standard direct maximum likelihood method ml newtonraphson for large samples we have previously applied this method to semiparametric shared gamma frailty models and verified by simulations the asymptotic and small sample statistical properties of the frailty variance estimates let theta sub 0 be the true value of the frailty variance parameter then the asymptotic distribution is normal for theta sub 00 while it is a 5050 mixture between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis for theta sub 00 for small samples simulations suggest that the frailty variance estimates are approximately distributed as an x100x mixture 0orxor50 between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis even for theta sub 00 we apply this method and verify by simulations these statistical results for semiparametric shared lognormal frailty models we also apply the semiparametric shared gamma and lognormal frailty models to busselton health study coronary heart disease data identifying multivariate discordant observations a computerintensive approach the problem of identifying multiple outliers in a multivariate normal sample is approached via successive testing using pvalues rather than tabled critical values caroni and prescott appl statist 41 p355 1992 proposed a generalization of the edresd procedure of rosner technometrics 25 1983 venter and viljoen comput statist data anal 29 p261 1999 introduced a computer intensive method to identify outliers in a univariate outlier situation we now generalize this method to the multivariate outlier situation and compare this new procedure with that of caroni and prescott appl statist 4 p355 1992 approximate confidence intervals for one proportion and difference of two proportions constructing a confidence interval for a binomial proportion or the difference of two proportions is a routine exercise in daily data analysis the bestknown method is the wald interval based on the asymptotic normal approximation to the distribution of the observed sample proportion though it is known to have bad performance for small to medium sample sizes agresti et al 1998 2000 proposed an adding4 method 4 pseudoobservations are added with 2 successes and 2 failures and then the resulting pseudosample proportion is used the method is simple and performs extremely well here we propose an approximate method based on a tapproximation that takes account of the uncertainty in estimating the variance of the observed pseudosample proportion it follows the same line of using a ttest rather than ztest in testing the mean of a normal distribution with an unknown variance for some circumstances our proposed method has a higher coverage probability than the adding4 method comparison of nonstationary time series in the frequency domain in this paper we compare two nonstationary time series using nonparametric procedures evolutionary spectra are estimated for the two series randomization tests are performed on groups of spectral estimates for both related and independent time series simulation studies show that in certain cases the tests perform reasonably well the tests are applied to observed geological and financial time series rank tests of association for exchangeable paired data we describe two rank tests of association for paired exchangeable data motivated by the study of lifespans in twins the pooled sample is ranked the nonparametric test of association is based on rsup  the sum of the smaller withinpair ranks a second measure lsup  is the sum of withinpair rank products under the null hypothesis of withinpair independence the two test statistics are approximately normally distributed expressions for the exact means and variances of rsup  and lsup  are given we describe the power of these two statistics under a close alternative hypothesis to that of independence both the rsup  and lsup  tests indicate nonparametric statistical evidence of positive association of longevity in identical twins and a negligible relationship between the lifespans of fraternal twins listed in the danish twin registry the statistics are also applied to the analysis of a clinical trial studying the time to failure of ventilation tubes in children with bilateral otitis media calibrated initials for an em applied to recursive models of categorical variables the estimates from an em when it is applied to a large causal model of 10 or more categorical variables are often subject to the initial values for the estimates this phenomenon becomes more serious as the model structure becomes more complicated involving more variables as a measure of compensation for this it has been recommended in literature that ems are implemented several times with different sets of initial values to obtain more appropriate estimates we propose an improved approach for initial values the main idea is that we use initials that are calibrated to data a simulation result strongly indicates that the calibrated initials give rise to the estimates that are far closer to the true values than the initials that are not calibrated geometric source separation merging convolutive source separation with geometric beamforming convolutive blind source separation and adaptive beamforming have a similar goalextracting a source of interest or multiple sources while reducing undesired interferences a benefit of source separation is that it overcomes the conventional crosstalk or leakage problem of adaptive beamforming beamforming on the other hand exploits geometric information which is often readily available but not utilized in blind algorithms we propose to join these benefits by combining crosspower minimization of secondorder source separation with geometric linear constraints used in adaptive beamforming we find that the geometric constraints resolve some of the ambiguities inherent in the independence criterion such as frequency permutations and degrees of freedom provided by additional sensors we demonstrate the new method in performance comparisons for actual room recordings of two and three simultaneous acoustic sources score tests for zeroinflated poisson models in many situations count data have a large proportion of zeros and the zeroinflated poisson regression zip model may be appropriate a simple score test for zeroinflation comparing the zip model with a constant proportion of excess zeros to a standard poisson regression model was given by van den broek 1995 we extend this test to the more general situation where the zero probability is allowed to depend on covariates the performance of this test is evaluated using a simulation study to identify potentially important covariates in the zeroinflation model a composite test is proposed the use of the general score test and the composite procedure is illustrated on two examples from the literature the composite score test is found to suggest appropriate models a modified fieller interval for the interval estimation of effective doses for a logistic doseresponse curve interval estimation of the gamma  effective dose  mu sub gamma  say is often based on the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator delta interval or fiellers theorem fieller interval sitter and wu 1993 compared the delta and fieller intervals for the median effective dose  mu sub 50 assuming a logistic doseresponse curve their results indicated that although fieller intervals are generally superior to delta intervals they appear to be conservative here an adjusted form of the fieller interval for mu sub gamma  termed an adjusted fieller af interval is introduced a comparison of the af interval with the delta and fieller intervals is provided and the properties of these three interval estimation methods are investigated modelling dependencies in paired comparison data a loglinear approach in many bradleyterry models a more or less explicit assumption is that all decisions of the judges are independent an assumption which might be questionable at least for the decisions of a given judge in paired comparison studies a judge chooses among objects several times and in such cases judgements made by the same judge are likely to be dependent a loglinear representation for the bradleyterry model is developed which takes into account dependencies between judgements the modelling of the dependencies is embedded in the analysis of multiple binomial responses which has the advantage of interpretability in terms of conditional odds ratios furthermore the modelling is done in the framework of generalized linear models thus parameter estimation and the assessment of goodness of fit can be obtained in the standard way by using eg glim or another standard software using knearestneighbor classification in the leaves of a tree we construct a hybrid composite classifier by combining two classifiers in common use  classification trees and knearestneighbor knn in our scheme we divide the feature space up by a classification tree and then classify test set items using the knn rule just among those training items in the same leaf as the test item this reduces somewhat the computational load associated with knn and it produces a classification rule that performs better than either trees or the usual knn in a number of wellknown data sets an approximation to the f distribution using the chisquare distribution for the cumulative distribution function cdf of the f distribution fx k n with associated degrees of freedom k and n a shrinking factor approximation sfa g lambda kx k is proposed for large n and any fixed k where gx k is the chisquare cdf with degrees of freedom k and lambda  lambda kx n is the shrinking factor numerical analysis indicates that for nk or 3 approximation accuracy of the sfa is to the fourth decimal place for most small values of k this is a substantial improvement on the accuracy that is achievable using the normal ordinary chisquare and scheffetukey approximations in addition it is shown that the theoretical approximation error of the sfa fx kng lambda kx k is o1nsup 2 uniformly over x detection and estimation of abrupt changes in the variability of a process detection of changepoints in normal means is a wellstudied problem the parallel problem of detecting changes in variance has had less attention the form of the generalized likelihood ratio test statistic has long been known but its null distribution resisted exact analysis in this paper we formulate the changepoint problem for a sequence of chisquare random variables we describe a procedure that is exact for the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic for all even degrees of freedom and gives upper and lower bounds for odd and also for noninteger degrees of freedom both the liberal and conservative bounds for chi sub 1sup 2 degrees of freedom are shown through simulation to be reasonably tight the important problem of testing for change in the normal variance of individual observations corresponds to the chi sub 1sup 2 case the nonnull case is also covered and confidence intervals for the true change point are derived the methodology is illustrated with an application to quality control in a deep level gold mine other applications include ambulatory monitoring of medical data and econometrics fliddl congestion control for layered multicast we describe fair layered increasedecrease with dynamic layering fliddl a new multirate congestion control algorithm for layered multicast sessions fliddl generalizes the receiverdriven layered congestion control protocol rlc introduced by vicisano et al proc ieee infocom san francisco ca  p9961003 mar 1998ameliorating the problems associated with large internet group management protocol igmp leave latencies and abrupt rate increases like rlc fliddl is a scalable receiverdriven congestion control mechanism in which receivers add layers at senderinitiated synchronization points and leave layers when they experience congestion fliddl congestion control coexists with transmission control protocol tcp flows as well as other fliddl sessions and supports general rates on the different multicast layers we demonstrate via simulations that our congestion control scheme exhibits better fairness properties and provides better throughput than previous methods a key contribution that enables fliddl and may be useful elsewhere is dynamic layering dl which mitigates the negative impact of long igmp leave latencies and eliminates the need for probe intervals present in rlc we use dl to respond to congestion much faster than igmp leave operations which have proven to be a bottleneck in practice for prior work a digital fountain approach to asynchronous reliable multicast the proliferation of applications that must reliably distribute large rich content to a vast number of autonomous receivers motivates the design of new multicast and broadcast protocols we describe an ideal fully scalable protocol for these applications that we call a digital fountain a digital fountain allows any number of heterogeneous receivers to acquire content with optimal efficiency at times of their choosing moreover no feedback channels are needed to ensure reliable delivery even in the face of high loss rates we develop a protocol that closely approximates a digital fountain using two new classes of erasure codes that for large block sizes are orders of magnitude faster than standard erasure codes we provide performance measurements that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and discuss the design implementation and performance of an experimental system scalable secure group communication over ip multicast we introduce and analyze a scalable rekeying scheme for implementing secure group communications internet protocol multicast we show that our scheme incurs constant processing message and storage overhead for a rekey operation when a single member joins or leaves the group and logarithmic overhead for bulk simultaneous changes to the group membership these bounds hold even when group dynamics are not known a priori our rekeying algorithm requires a particular clustering of the members of the secure multicast group we describe a protocol to achieve such clustering and show that it is feasible to efficiently cluster members over realistic internetlike topologies we evaluate the overhead of our own rekeying scheme and also of previously published schemes via simulation over an internet topology map containing over 280 000 routers through analysis and detailed simulations we show that this rekeying scheme performs better than previous schemes for a single change to group membership further for bulk group changes our algorithm outperforms all previously known schemes by several orders of magnitude in terms of actual bandwidth usage processing costs and storage requirements distributed servers approach for largescale secure multicast in order to offer backward and forward secrecy for multicast applications ie a new member cannot decrypt the multicast data sent before its joining and a former member cannot decrypt the data sent after its leaving the data encryption key has to be changed whenever a user joins or leaves the system such a change has to be made known to all the current users the bandwidth used for such rekey messaging can be high when the user pool is large we propose a distributed servers approach to minimize the overall system bandwidth and complexity by splitting the user pool into multiple groups each served by a logical server after presenting an analytic model for the system based on a hierarchical key tree we show that there is an optimal number of servers to achieve minimum system bandwidth as the underlying user traffic fluctuates we propose a simple dynamic scheme with low overhead where a physical server adaptively splits and merges its traffic into multiple groups each served by a logical server so as to minimize its total bandwidth our results show that a distributed servers approach is able to substantially reduce the total bandwidth required as compared with the traditional singleserver approach especially for those applications with a large user pool short holding time and relatively low bandwidth of a data stream as in the internet stock quote applications speech enhancement using a mixturemaximum model we present a spectral domain speech enhancement algorithm the new algorithm is based on a mixture model for the short time spectrum of the clean speech signal and on a maximum assumption in the production of the noisy speech spectrum in the past this model was used in the context of noise robust speech recognition in this paper we show that this model is also effective for improving the quality of speech signals corrupted by additive noise the computational requirements of the algorithm can be significantly reduced essentially without paying performance penalties by incorporating a dual codebook scheme with tied variances experiments using recorded speech signals and actual noise sources show that in spite of its low computational requirements the algorithm shows improved performance compared to alternative speech enhancement algorithms scribe a largescale and decentralized applicationlevel multicast infrastructure this paper presents scribe a scalable applicationlevel multicast infrastructure scribe supports large numbers of groups with a potentially large number of members per group scribe is built on top of pastry a generic peertopeer object location and routing substrate overlayed on the internet and leverages pastrys reliability selforganization and locality properties pastry is used to create and manage groups and to build efficient multicast trees for the dissemination of messages to each group scribe provides besteffort reliability guarantees and we outline how an application can extend scribe to provide stronger reliability simulation results based on a realistic network topology model show that scribe scales across a wide range of groups and group sizes also it balances the load on the nodes while achieving acceptable delay and link stress when compared with internet protocol multicast multiecho segmented epi with zshimmed background gradient compensation mesbac pulse sequence for fmri a multiecho segmented epi with zshimmed background gradient compensation mesbac pulse sequence is proposed and validated for functional mri fmri study in regions suffering from severe susceptibility artifacts this sequence provides an effective tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution and reduces image distortion and signal dropout the blood oxygenation leveldependent boldweighted fmri signal can be reliably obtained in the region of the orbitofrontal cortex ofc to overcome physiological motion artifacts during prolonged multisegment epi acquisition two sets of navigator echoes were acquired in both the readout and phaseencoding directions ghost artifacts generally produced by singleshot epi acquisition were eliminated by separately placing the even and odd echoes in different kspace trajectories unlike most zshim methods that focus on increasing temporal resolution for eventrelated functional brain mapping the mesbac sequence simultaneously addresses problems of image distortion and signal dropout while maintaining sufficient temporal resolution the mesbac sequence will be particularly useful for pharmacological and affective fmri studies in brain regions such as the ofc nucleus accumbens amygdala parahippocampus etc reconstruction of mr images from data acquired on an arbitrary kspace trajectory using the sameimage weight a sampling density compensation function denoted sameimage si weight is proposed to reconstruct mr images from the data acquired on an arbitrary kspace trajectory an equation for the si weight is established on the si criterion and an iterative scheme is developed to find the weight the si weight is then used to reconstruct images from the data calculated on a random trajectory in a numerical phantom case and from the data acquired on interleaved spirals in an in vivo experiment respectively in addition pipe and menons weight mrm 199941179186 is also used in the reconstructions to make a comparison the images obtained with the si weight were found to be slightly more accurate than those obtained with pipes weight timeresolved contrastenhanced imaging with isotropic resolution and broad coverage using an undersampled 3d projection trajectory timeresolved contrastenhanced 3d mr angiography mra methods have gained in popularity but are still limited by the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution a method is presented that greatly reduces this tradeoff by employing undersampled 3d projection reconstruction trajectories the variable density kspace sampling intrinsic to this sequence is combined with temporal kspace interpolation to provide time frames as short as 4 s this time resolution reduces the need for exact contrast timing while also providing dynamic information spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the fov which is also isotropic although undersampling the outer regions of kspace introduces aliased energy into the image which may compromise resolution this is not a limiting factor in highcontrast applications such as mra results from phantom and volunteer studies are presented demonstrating isotropic resolution broad coverage with an isotropic field of view fov minimal projection reconstruction artifacts and temporal information in one application a single breathhold exam covering the entire pulmonary vasculature generates highresolution isotropic imaging volumes depicting the bolus passage threedimensional spiral mr imaging application to renal multiphase contrastenhanced angiography a fast mr pulse sequence with spiral inplane readout and conventional 3d partition encoding was developed for multiphase contrastenhanced magnetic resonance angiography cemra of the renal vasculature compared to a standard multiphase 3d cemra with flash readout an isotropic inplane spatial resolution of 1414 mmsup 2 over 2014 mmsup 2 could be achieved with a temporal resolution of 6 sec the theoretical gain of spatial resolution by using the spiral pulse sequence and the performance in the presence of turbulent flow was evaluated in phantom measurements multiphase 3d cemra of the renal arteries was performed in five healthy volunteers using both techniques a deblurring technique was used to correct the spiral raw data thereby the offresonance frequencies were determined by minimizing the imaginary part of the data in image space the chosen correction algorithm was able to reduce image blurring substantially in all mra phases the image quality of the spiral cemra pulse sequence was comparable to that of the flash cemra with increased spatial resolution and a 25 reduced contrasttonoise ratio additionally artifacts specific to spiral mri could be observed which had no impact on the assessment of the renal arteries oxygenenhanced mri of the brain blood oxygenation leveldependent bold contrast mri is a potential method for a physiological characterization of tissue beyond mere morphological representation the purpose of this study was to develop evaluation techniques for such examinations using a hyperoxia challenge administration of pure oxygen was applied to test these techniques as pure oxygen can be expected to induce relatively small signal intensity si changes compared to cosub 2containing gases and thus requires very sensitive evaluation methods fourteen volunteers were investigated by alternating between breathing 100 osub 2 and normal air using two different paradigms of administration changes ranged from 30 in large veins to 171or014 in basal ganglia and 082or008 in white matter to account for a slow physiological response function a reference for correlation analysis was derived from the venous reaction an objective method is presented that allows the adaptation of the significance threshold to the complexity of the paradigm used reference signal characteristics in representative brain tissue regions were established as the presented evaluation scheme proved its applicability to small si changes induced by pure oxygen it can readily be used for similar experiments with other gases vibration control of structure by using tuned mass damper development of system which suppress displacement of auxiliary mass in vibration control of a structure by using an active tuned mass damper atmd stroke of the auxiliary mass is so limited that it is difficult to control the vibration in the case of large disturbance input in this paper two methods are proposed for the problem one of the methods is a switching control system by two types of controllers one of the controllers is a normal controller under small relative displacement of the auxiliary mass and the other is not effective only for first mode of vibration under large relative displacement of the auxiliary mass new variable gain control system is constructed by switching these two controllers the other method is the brake system in active vibration control it is necessary to use actuator for active control by using the actuator the proposed system puts on the brake to suppress displacement increase of the auxiliary mass under large disturbance input finally the systems are designed and the effectiveness of the systems is confirmed by the simulation experimental design methodology and data analysis technique applied to optimise an organic synthesis the study was aimed at maximising the yield of a michaelisbecker dibromoalkane monophosphorylation reaction in order to save time and money we first applied a full factorial experimental design to search for the optimum conditions while performing a small number of experiments we then used the principal component analysis pca technique to evidence two uncontrolled factors lastly a special experimental design that took into account all the influential factors allowed us to determine the maximumyield experimental conditions this study also evidenced the complementary nature of experimental design methodology and data analysis techniques study of ambiguities inherent to the spectral analysis of voigt profilesa modified simplex approach in pulsed spectrometries temporal transients are often analyzed directly in the temporal domain assuming they consist only of purely exponentially decaying sinusoids when experimental spectra actually consist of gaussian or voigt profiles gausslorentz profiles we show that the direct methods may erroneously interpret such lines as the sum of two or more lorentzian profiles using a nelder and mead simplex method modified by introducing new means to avoid degeneracies and quenchings in secondary minima we demonstrate that a large number of different solutions can be obtained with equivalent accuracy over the limited acquisition time interval with final peak parameters devoid of physical or chemical meaning methods for outlier detection in prediction if a prediction sample is different from the calibration samples it can be considered as an outlier in prediction in this work two techniques the use of uncertainty estimation and the convex hull method are studied to detect such prediction outliers classical techniques mahalanobis distance and xresiduals potential functions and robust techniques are used for comparison it is concluded that the combination of the convex hull method and uncertainty estimation offers a practical way for detecting outliers in prediction by adding the potential function method inliers can also be detected the use of subtypes and stereotypes in the uml model based on users experiences of version 13 of the unified modeling language uml of the object management group omg a request for information in 1999 elicited several responses which were asked to identify problems but not to offer any solutions one of these responses is examined for problems relating to the uml metamodel and here some solutions to the problems identified there are proposed specifically we evaluate the metamodel relating to stereotypes versus subtypes the various kinds of classifier particularly types interfaces and classes the introduction of a new subtype for the whole part relationship as well as identifying areas in the metamodel where the uml seems to have been used inappropriately in the very definition of the umls metamodel molecular descriptor selection combining genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic application to database mining procedures a new algorithm devoted to molecular descriptor selection in the context of data mining problems has been developed this algorithm is based on the concepts of genetic algorithms ga for descriptor hyperspace exploration and combined with a stepwise approach to get local convergence its selection power was evaluated by a fitness function derived from a fuzzy clustering method different training and test sets were randomly generated at each ga generation the fitness score was derived by combining the scores of the training and test sets the ability of the proposed algorithm to select relevant subsets of descriptors was tested on two data sets the first one an academic example corresponded to the artificial problem of bullseye the second was a real data set including 114 olfactory compounds divided into three odor categories in both cases the proposed method allowed to improve the separation between the different data set classes applicationlayer multicasting with delaunay triangulation overlays applicationlayer multicast supports group applications without the need for a networklayer multicast protocol here applications arrange themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within the overlay we present an applicationlayer multicast solution that uses a delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology an advantage of using a delaunay triangulation is that it allows each application to locally derive nexthop routing information without requiring a routing protocol in the overlay a disadvantage of using a delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal we present a protocol called delaunay triangulation dt protocol which constructs delaunay triangulation overlay networks we present measurement experiments of the dt protocol for overlay networks with up to 10 000 members that are running on a local pc cluster with 100 linux pcs the results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly eg an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over 30 s the traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network is in a steady state results of throughput experiments of multicast transmissions using tcp unicast connections between neighbors in the overlay network show an achievable throughput of approximately 15 mbs in an overlay with 100 nodes and 2 mbs in an overlay with 1000 nodes a case for end system multicast the conventional wisdom has been that internet protocol ip is the natural protocol layer for implementing multicast related functionality however more than a decade after its initial proposal ip multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability network management deployment and support for higher layer functionality such as error flow and congestion control we explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication this shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with ip multicast however the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model in particular end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger endtoend delays than ip multicast we study these performance concerns in the context of the narada protocol in narada end systems selforganize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol further end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance we present details of narada and evaluate it using both simulation and internet experiments our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives we believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred indexingneglected and poorly understood the growth of the internet has highlighted the use of machine indexing the difficulties in using the internet as a searching device can be frustrating the use of the term python is given as an example machine indexing is noted as rotten and human indexing as capricious the problem seems to be a lack of a theoretical foundation for the art of indexing what librarians have learned over the last hundred years has yet to yield a consistent approach to what really works best in preparing index terms and in the ability of our customers to search the various indexes an attempt is made to consider the elements of indexing their pros and cons the argument is made that machine indexing is far too prolific in its production of index terms neither librarians nor computer programmers have made much progress to improve internet indexing human indexing has had the same problems for over fifty years a question of perspective assigning library of congress subject headings to classical literature and ancient history this article explains the concept of world view and shows how the world view of cataloguers influences the development and assignment of subject headings to works about other cultures and civilizations using works from classical literature and ancient history as examples cataloguers are encouraged to evaluate the headings they assign to works in classical literature and ancient history in terms of the world views of ancient greece and rome so that headings reflect the contents of the works they describe and give fuller expression to the diversity of thoughts and themes that characterize these ancient civilizations mapping ccf to marc21 an experimental approach the purpose of this article is to raise and address a number of issues pertaining to the conversion of common communication format ccf into marc21 in this era of global resource sharing exchange of bibliographic records from one system to another is imperative in todays library communities instead of using a single standard to create machinereadable catalogue records more than 20 standards have emerged and are being used by different institutions because of these variations in standards sharing of resources and transfer of data from one system to another among the institutions locally and globally has become a significant problem addressing this problem requires keeping in mind that countries such as india and others in southeast asia are using the ccf as a standard for creating bibliographic cataloguing records this paper describes a way to map the bibliographic catalogue records from ccf to marc21 although 100 mapping is not possible in addition the paper describes an experimental approach that enumerates problems that may occur during the mapping of recordsexchanging of records and how these problems can be overcome the catalogers workstation revisited utilizing catalogers desktop a few years into the development of catalogers desktop an electronic cataloging tool aggregator available through the library of congress is an opportune time to assess its impact on cataloging operations a search for online cataloging tools on the internet indicates a proliferation of cataloging tool aggregators which provide access to online documentation related to cataloging practices and procedures catalogers desktop stands out as a leader among these aggregators results of a survey to assess 159 academic arl and large public libraries reasons for use or nonuse of catalogers desktop highlight the necessity of developing strategies for its successful implementation including training staff providing documentation and managing technical issues the web

 no longer a barrier agile business web services will be a critical technology for enabling the agile business regression testing of database applications database applications features such as structured query language or sql exception programming integrity constraints and table triggers pose difficulties for maintenance activities especially for regression testing that follows modifications to database applications in this work we address these difficulties and propose a two phase regression testing methodology in phase 1 we explore control flow and data flow analysis issues of database applications then we propose an impact analysis technique that is based on dependencies that exist among the components of database applications this analysis leads to selecting test cases from the initial test suite for regression testing the modified application in phase 2 further reduction in the regression test cases is performed by using reduction algorithms we present two such algorithms the graph walk algorithm walks through the control flow graph of database modules and selects a safe set of test cases to retest the call graph firewall algorithm uses a firewall for the inter procedural level finally a maintenance environment for database applications is described our experience with this regression testing methodology shows that the impact analysis technique is adequate for selecting regression tests and that phase 2 techniques can be used for further reduction in the number of theses tests at your service agile businesses senior software executives from

jeopardising existing supplier relationships in a recent survey amr research found that companies that use reverse auctions to negotiate prices with suppliers typically achieve savings of between 10 and 15 on direct goods and between 20 and 25 on indirect goods and can slash sourcing cycle times from months to weeks suppliers however are less enthusiastic they believe that these savings are achieved only by stripping the human element out of negotiations and evaluating bids on price alone which drives down their profit margins as a result reverse auctions carry the risk of jeopardising longterm and trusted relationships suppliers that have not been involved in a reverse auction before typically fear the bidding event itself  arguably the most theatrical and therefore most hypedup

research directions this study reviews and synthesizes human factors research on conceptual data modeling in addition to analyzing the variables used in earlier studies and summarizing the results of this stream of research we propose a new framework to help with future efforts in this area the study finds that prior research has focused on issues that are relevant when conceptual models are used for communication between systems analysts and developers analyst developer models whereas the issues important for models that are used to facilitate communication between analysts and users useranalyst models have received little attention and hence require a significantly stronger role in future research in addition we emphasize the importance of building a strong theoretical foundation

results obtained in the study reveal that cbp algorithm is a useful tool for qualitative as well as quantitative assessment of composite regions encountered in engineering applications active vibration control of piezolaminated smart beams this paper deals with the active vibration control of beam like structures with distributed piezoelectric sensor and actuator layers bonded on top and bottom surfaces of the beam a finite element model based on eulerbernoulli beam theory has been developed the contribution of the piezoelectric sensor and actuator layers on the mass and stiffness of the beam is considered three types of classical control strategies namely direct proportional feedback constantgain negative velocity feedback and lyapunov feedback and an optimal control strategy linear quadratic regulator lqr scheme are applied to study their control effectiveness also the control performance with different types of loading such as impulse loading step loading harmonic and random loading is studied continuoustime linear systems folklore and fact we consider a family of continuous inputoutput maps representing linear timeinvariant systems that take a set of signals into itself it is shown that this family contains maps whose impulse response is the zero function but which take certain inputs into nonzero outputs it is shown also that this family contains members whose inputoutput properties are not described by their frequency domain response functions and that the maps considered need not even commute sensitivity calibration of ultrasonic detectors based using add diagrams the paper considers basic problems related to utilization of add diagrams in calibrating sensitivity of ultrasonic detectors we suggest that a convenient tool for solving such problems can be the software package add universal version 21 designed for plotting individual add diagrams for normal and slanted transducers the software is compatible with the contemporary operational system windows9598 reference signals for calibration are generated in a sample with cylindrical holes robust kalman filter design for discrete timedelay systems the problem of finite and infinitehorizon robust kalman filtering for uncertain discretetime systems with state delay is addressed the system under consideration is subject to timevarying normbounded parameter uncertainty in both the state and output matrices we develop a new methodology for designing a linear filter such that the error variance of the filter is guaranteed to be within a certain upper bound for any allowed uncertainty and time delay the solution is given in terms of two riccati equations multiple timedelay systems are also investigated robust outputfeedback control for linear continuous uncertain state delayed systems with unknown time delay the statedelayed time often is unknown and independent of other variables in most real physical systems a new stability criterion for uncertain systems with a state timevarying delay is proposed then a robust observerbased control law based on this criterion is constructed via the sequential quadratic programming method we also develop a separation property so that the state feedback control law and observer can be independently designed and maintain closedloop system stability an example illustrates the availability of the proposed design method a partial converse to hadamards theorem on homeomorphisms a theorem by hadamard gives a twopart condition under which a map from one banach space to another is a homeomorphism the theorem while often very useful is incomplete in the sense that it does not explicitly specify the family of maps for which the condition is met here under a typically weak additional assumption on the map we show that hadamards condition is met if and only if the map is a homeomorphism with a lipschitz continuous inverse an application is given concerning the relation between the stability of a nonlinear system and the stability of related linear systems lifting factorization of discrete w transform a general method is proposed to factor the typeiv discrete w transform dwtiv into lifting steps and additions then based on the relationships among various types of dwts four types of dwts are factored into lifting steps and additions after approximating the lifting matrices we get four types of new integer dwts intdwti intdwtii intdwtiii and intdwtiv which are floatingpoint multiplication free integertointeger transforms iidwt which approximate to dwt are also proposed fast algorithms are given for the new transforms and their computational complexities are analyzed a novel genetic algorithm for the design of a signed poweroftwo coefficient quadrature mirror filter lattice filter bank a novel genetic algorithm ga for the design of a canonical signed poweroftwo spt coefficient lattice structure quadrature mirror filter bank is presented genetic operations may render the spt representation of a value noncanonical a new encoding scheme is introduced to encode the spt values in this new scheme the canonical property of the spt values is preserved under genetic operations additionally two new features that drastically improve the performance of our ga are introduced 1 an additional level of natural selection is introduced to simulate the effect of natural selection when sperm cells compete to fertilize an ovule this dramatically improves the offspring survival rate a conventional ga is analogous to intracytoplasmic sperm injection and has an extremely low offspring survival rate resulting in very slow convergence 2 the probability of mutation for each codon of a chromosome is weighted by the reciprocal of its effect because of these new features the performance of our new ga outperforms conventional gas design of highperformance wavelets for image coding using a perceptual time domain criterion this paper presents a new biorthogonal linearphase wavelet design for image compression instead of calculating the prototype filters as spectral factors of a halfband filter the design is based on the direct optimization of the low pass analysis filter using an objective function directly related to a perceptual criterion for image compression this function is defined as the product of the theoretical coding gain and an index called the peaktopeak ratio which was shown to have high correlation with perceptual quality a distinctive feature of the proposed technique is a procedure by which given a good starting filter good filters of longer lengths are generated the results are excellent showing a clear improvement in perceptual image quality also we devised a criterion for constraining the coefficients of the filters in order to design wavelets with minimum ringing design and implementation of a new slidingmode observer for speedsensorless control of induction machine in this letter a new slidingmodesensorless control algorithm is proposed for the fieldoriented induction machine drive in the proposed algorithm the terms containing flux speed and rotor time constant which are common in both current and flux equations in the current model of the induction machine are estimated by a sliding function the flux and speed estimation accuracy is guaranteed when the error between the actual current and observed current converges to zero hence the fourthorder system is reduced to two secondorder systems and the speed estimation becomes very simple and robust to the parameter uncertainties the new approach is verified by simulation and experimental results schedulability analysis of realtime traffic in worldfip networks an integrated approach the worldfip protocol is one of the profiles that constitute the european fieldbus standard en50170 it is particularly well suited to be used in distributed computercontrolled systems where a set of process variables must be shared among network devices to cope with the realtime requirements of such systems the protocol provides communication services based on the exchange of periodic and aperiodic identified variables the periodic exchanges have the highest priority and are executed at run time according to a cyclic schedule therefore the respective schedulability can be determined at preruntime when building the schedule table concerning the aperiodic exchanges the situation is different since their priority is lower and they are bandied according to a firstcomefirstserved policy in this paper a responsetimebased schedulability analysis for the realtime traffic is presented such analysis considers both types of traffic in an integrated way according to their priorities furthermore a fixedprioritiesbased policy is also used to schedule the periodic traffic the proposed analysis represents an improvement relative to previous work and it can be evaluated online as part of a traffic online admission control this feature is of particular importance when a planning scheduler is used instead of the typical offline static scheduler to allow online changes to the set of periodic process variables robust stability analysis for currentprogrammed regulators uncertainty models for the three basic switchmode converters buck boost and buckboost are given in this paper the resulting models are represented by linear fractional transformations with structured dynamic uncertainties uncertainties are assumed for the load resistance rrsub o1 delta sub r inductance llsub o1 delta sub l and capacitance ccsub o1 delta sub c the interest in these models is clearly motivated by the need to have models for switchmode dcdc converters that are compatible with robust control analysis which require a model structure consisting of a nominal model and a normbounded modeling uncertainty therefore robust stability analysis can be realized using standard mu tools at the end of the paper an illustrative example is given which shows the simplicity of the procedure novel line conditioner with voltage updown capability in this paper a novel pulsewidthmodulated line conditioner with fast output voltage control is proposed the line conditioner is made up of an ac chopper with reversible voltage control and a transformer for series voltage compensation in the ac chopper a proper switching operation is achieved without the commutation problem to absorb energy stored in line stray inductance a regenerative dc snubber can be utilized which has only one capacitor without discharging resistors or complicated regenerative circuit for snubber energy therefore the proposed ac chopper gives high efficiency and reliability the output voltage of the line conditioner is controlled using a fast sensing technique of the output voltage it is also shown via some experimental results that the presented line conditioner gives good dynamic and steadystate performance for high quality of the output voltage antispam suit attempts

need for end user oriented research considerable attention has been given to the technical and policy issues involved with it security issues in recent years the growth of ecommerce and the internet as well as widely publicized hacker attacks have brought it security into prominent focus and routine corporate attention yet much more research is needed from the end user eu perspective this position paper is a call for such research and outlines some possible directions of interest digital stochastic realization of complex analog controllers stochastic logic is based on digital processing of a random pulse stream where the information is codified as the probability of a high level in a finite sequence this binary pulse sequence can be digitally processed exploiting the similarity between boolean algebra and statistical algebra given a random pulse sequence any boolean operation among individual pulses will correspond to an algebraic expression among the variables represented by their respective average pulse rates subsequently this pulse stream can be digitally processed to perform analog operations in this paper we propose a stochastic approach to the digital implementation of complex controllers using programmable devices as an alternative to traditional digital signal processors as an example a practical realization of nonlinear dissipative controllers for a series resonant converter is presented high dynamic control of a threelevel voltagesourceconverter drive for a main strip mill a high dynamic control system for the alspa vdm 7000 mediumvoltage drive was implemented which provides fast torque response times of a few milliseconds despite the typically low switching frequency of gateturnoff thyristors which is necessary to achieve high efficiency the drive system consists of a threelevel voltagesource converter with active front end and a synchronous motor the drive has most recently been applied to a main strip mill it provides a maximum of 83mw mechanical power with a rated motor voltage of 3 kv besides motor torque as the main control objective the control system has to comply with a number of additional objectives and constraints like dclink voltage regulation and balancing current and torque harmonics motor flux and excitation a comparison of highpower converter topologies for the implementation of facts controllers this paper compares four power converter topologies for the implementation of flexible ac transmission system facts controllers three multilevel topologies multipoint clamped mpc chain and nested cell and the wellestablished multipulse topology in keeping with the need to implement veryhighpower inverters switching frequency is restricted to line frequency the study addresses device count dc filter ratings restrictions on voltage control active power transfer through the dc link and balancing of dclink voltages emphasis is placed on capacitor sizing because of its impact on the cost and size of the facts controller a method for the dimensioning the dc capacitor filter is presented it is found that the chain converter is attractive for the implementation of a static compensator or a static synchronous series compensator the mpc converter is attractive for the implementation of a unified power flow controller or an interline power flow controller but a special arrangement is required to overcome the limitations on voltage control direct self control with minimum torque ripple and high dynamics for a double threelevel gto inverter drive a highly dynamic control scheme with very low torque rippledirect self control dsc with torque hysteresis controlfor very highpower mediumvoltage induction motor drives fed by a double threelevel inverter d3li is presented in this arrangement two threelevel inverters that are connected in parallel at their dc sides are feeding the open motor windings the dsc well known from two and threelevel inverters is adapted to the d3li and optimized for a minimum torque ripple an 18corner trajectory is chosen for the stator flux of the induction machine since it is approaching the ideal circle much better than the hexagon known from dsc for twolevel inverters without any detriment to the torque ripple the machine and inverter control are explained and the proposed torque quality and dynamics are verified by measurements on a 180kw laboratory drive multicell converters active control and observation of flyingcapacitor voltages the multicell converters introduced more than ten years ago make it possible to distribute the voltage constraints among seriesconnected switches and to improve the output waveforms increased number of levels and apparent frequency the balance of the constraints requires an appropriate distribution of the flying voltages this paper presents some solutions for the active control of the voltages across the flying capacitors in the presence of rapid variation of the input voltage the latter part of this paper is dedicated to the observation of these voltages using an original modeling of the converter use of extra degrees of freedom in multilevel drives multilevel converters with series connection of semiconductors allow power electronics to reach medium voltages 110 kv with relatively standard components the increase of the number of semiconductors provides extra degrees of freedom which can be used to improve different characteristics this paper is focused on variablespeed drives and it is shown that with the proposed multilevel direct torque control strategy dicoif the tradeoff between the performances of the drive harmonic distortions torque dynamics voltage step gradients etc and the switching frequency of the semiconductors is improved then a slightly modified strategy reducing commonmode voltage and bearing currents is presented enhancing the reliability of modular mediumvoltage drives a method to increase the reliability of modular mediumvoltage induction motor drives is discussed by providing means to bypass a failed module the impact on reliability is shown a control which maximizes the output voltage available after bypass is described and experimental results are given vector algebra proofs for geometry theorems vector mathematics can generate simple and powerful proofs of theorems in plane geometry these proofs can also be used to generalize plane geometry theorems to higher dimensions we present three vector proofs that show the power of this technique 1 for any quadrilateral the sum of the squares of the diagonals is less than or equal to the sum of the squares of the sides 2 the area of a quadrilateral is half the product of the diagonals multiplied by the sine of an included angle 3 one quarter of all triangles are acute based upon the options detailed below with respect to the relative lengths of the sides this paper presents a set of examples of vector mathematics applied to geometry problems some of the most beautiful and sophisticated proofs in mathematics involve using multiple representations of the same data by leveraging the advantages of each representation one finds new and useful mathematical facts sufficient conditions on nonemptiness and boundedness of the solution set of the psub 0 function nonlinear complementarity problem the psub 0 function nonlinear complementarity problem ncp has attracted a lot of attention among researchers various assumed conditions which ensure that the ncp has a solution have been proposed in this paper by using the notion of an exceptional family of elements we develop a sufficient condition which ensures that the solution set of the psub 0 function ncp is nonempty and bounded in particular we prove that many existing assumed conditions imply this sufficient condition thus these conditions imply that the solution set of the psub 0 function ncp is nonempty and bounded in addition we also prove directly that a few existence conditions imply that the solution set of the psub 0 function ncp is bounded cooperative mutation based evolutionary programming for continuous function optimization an evolutionary programming ep algorithm adapting a new mutation operator is presented unlike most previous eps in which each individual is mutated on its own each individual in the proposed algorithm is mutated in cooperation with the other individuals this not only enhances convergence speed but also gives more chance to escape from local minima a study of computer attitudes of noncomputing students of technical colleges in brunei darussalam the study surveyed 268 noncomputing students among three technical colleges in brunei darussalam the study validated an existing instrument to measure computer attitudes of noncomputing students and identified factors that contributed to the formation of their attitudes the findings show that computer experience and educational qualification are associated with students computer attitudes in contrast variables such as gender age ownership of a personal computer pc geographical location of institution and prior computer training appeared to have no impact on computer attitudes optimal allocation of runs in a simulation metamodel with several independent variables cheng and kleijnen 1999 propose a very general regression metamodel for modelling the output of a queuing system its main limitations are that the regression function is based on a polynomial and that it can use only one independent variable these limitations are removed here we derive an explicit formula for the optimal way of assigning simulation runs to the different design points on bivariate dependence and the convex order we investigate the interplay between variability in the sense of the convex order and dependence in a bivariate framework extending some previous results in this area we exploit the fact that discrete uniform distributions are dense in the space of probability measures in the topology of weak convergence to prove our central result we also obtain a partial result in the general multivariate case our findings can be interpreted in terms of the impact of component variability on the mean life of correlated serial and parallel systems waitingtime distribution of a discretetime multiserver queue with correlated arrivals and deterministic service times dmapdk system we derive the waitingtime distribution of a discretetime multiserver queue with correlated arrivals and deterministic or constant service times we show that the procedure for obtaining the waitingtime distribution of a multiserver queue is reduced to that of a singleserver queue we present a complete solution to the waitingtime distribution of dmapdk queue together with some computational results efficient feasibility testing for dialaride problems dialaride systems involve dispatching a vehicle to satisfy demands from a set of customers who call a vehicleoperating agency requesting that an item tie picked up from a specific location and delivered to a specific destination dialaride problems differ from other routing and scheduling problems in that they typically involve servicerelated constraints it is common to have maximum wait time constraints and maximum ride time constraints in the presence of maximum wait time and maximum ride time restrictions it is not clear how to efficiently determine given a sequence of pickups and deliveries whether a feasible schedule exists we demonstrate that this in fact can be done in linear time embeddings of planar graphs that minimize the number of longface cycles we consider the problem of finding embeddings of planar graphs that minimize the number of longface cycles we prove that for any k or 4 it is npcomplete to find an embedding that minimizes the number of face cycles of length at least k the quadratic 01 knapsack problem with seriesparallel support we consider various special cases of the quadratic 01 knapsack problem qkp for which the underlying graph structure is fairly simple for the variant with edge seriesparallel graphs we give a dynamic programming algorithm with pseudopolynomial time complexity and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme in strong contrast to this the variant with vertex seriesparallel graphs is shown to be strongly npcomplete algorithmic results for ordered median problems in a series of papers a new type of objective function in location theory called ordered median function has been introduced and analyzed this objective function unifies and generalizes most common objective functions used in location theory in this paper we identify finite dominating sets for these models and develop polynomial time algorithms together with a detailed complexity analysis a network simplex algorithm with on consecutive degenerate pivots we suggest a pivot rule for the primal simplex algorithm for the minimum cost flow problem known as the network simplex algorithm due to degeneracy cycling may occur in the network simplex algorithm the cycling can be prevented by maintaining strongly feasible bases proposed by cunningham 1976 however if we do not impose any restrictions on the entering variables the algorithm can still perform an exponentially long sequence of degenerate pivots this phenomenon is known as stalling researchers have suggested several pivot rules with the following bounds on the number of consecutive degenerate pivots m nsup 2 kk  12 where n is the number of nodes in the network m is the number of arcs in the network and k is the number of degenerate arcs in the basis observe that k or n in this paper we describe an antistalling pivot rule that ensures that the network simplex algorithm performs at most k consecutive degenerate pivots this rule uses a negative cost augmenting cycle to identify a sequence of entering variables new water management system begins operation at

on the basis of the firmware system sargon the economic difficulties experienced by the power industry of russia has considerably retarded the speed of commissioning new capacities and reconstructing equipment in service the increasing deterioration of the equipment at power stations makes the problem of its updating very acute the main efforts of organizations working in the power industry are now focused on updating all kinds of equipment installed at power installations the necessary condition for the efficient operation of power equipment is to carry out serious modernization of systems

implementation a study of small business owners according to previous studies attitude towards information technology it among small business owners appears to be a key factor in achieving high quality it implementations in an effort to extend this stream of research we conducted case studies with small business owners and learned that high quality it implementations resulted with owners who had positive or negative attitudes toward it but not with owners who had uncertain attitudes owners with apolar attitude either positive or negative all took action to temper the uncertainty and risk surrounding the use of new it in their organization in contrast owners with uncertain attitudes did not make mitigating attempts to reduce uncertainty and risk a consistent finding among those with high quality it implementations was an entrepreneurial or shared management style it is proposed based on case study data that small business owners with an uncertain attitude towards it might experience higher quality it results in their organizations through practicing a more entrepreneurial or shared management style the study provides insights for both computer specialists and small business owners planning it implementations multihour design of survivable classical ip networks most of internet intradomain routing protocols ospf rip and isis are based on shortest path routing the path length is defined as the sum of metrics associated with the path links these metrics are often managed by the network administrator in this context the design of an internet backbone network consists in dimensioning the network routers and transmission links and establishing the metric many requirements have to be satisfied first internet traffic is not static as significant variations can be observed during the day second many failures can occur cable cuts hardware failures software failures etc we present algorithms metaheuristics and greedy heuristic to design internet backbone networks taking into account the multihour behaviour of traffic and some survivability requirements many multihour and protection strategies are studied and numerically compared our algorithms can be extended to integrate other quality of service constraints aggregate bandwidth estimation in stored video distribution systems multimedia applications like video on demand distance learning internet video broadcast etc will play a fundamental role in future broadband networks a common aspect of such applications is the transmission of video streams that require a sustained relatively high bandwidth with stringent requirements of quality of service in this paper various original algorithms for evaluating in a video distribution system a statistical estimation of aggregate bandwidth needed by a given number of smoothed video streams are proposed and discussed the variable bit rate traffic generated by each video stream is characterized by its marginal distribution and by conditional probabilities between rates of temporary closed streams the developed iterative algorithms evaluate an upper and lower bound of needed bandwidth for guaranteeing a given loss probability the obtained results are compared with simulations and with other results based on similar assumptions already presented in the literature some considerations on the developed algorithms are made in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods a unifying cooperative web caching architecture network caching of objects has become a standard way of reducing network traffic and latency in the web however web caches exhibit poor performance with a hit rate of about 30 a solution to improve this hit rate is to have a group of proxies form cooperation where objects can be cached for later retrieval a cooperative cache system includes protocols for hierarchical and transversal caching the drawback of such a system lies in the resulting network load due to the number of messages that need to be exchanged to locate an object this paper proposes a new cooperative web caching architecture which unifies previous methods of web caching performance results shows that the architecture achieve up to 70 cooperative hit rate and accesses the cached object in at most two hops moreover the architecture is scalable with low traffic and database overhead voip makeover

uptake of computer supported cooperative working researchers in information systems have produced a rich collection of metaanalyses and models to further understanding of factors influencing the uptake of information technologies in the domain of cscw however these models have largely been neglected and while there are many case studies no systematic account of uptake has been produced we use findings from information systems research to structure a metaanalysis of uptake issues as reported in cscw case studies supplemented by a detailed reexamination of one of our own case studies from this perspective this shows that while there are some factors which seem to be largely specific to cscw introductions many of the case study results are very similar to standard is findings we conclude by suggesting how the two communities of researchers might build on each others work and finally propose activity theory as a means of integrating the two perspectives the malaysian model

based affine registration including feature similarity for spatial normalization this paper presents a new spatial normalization with affine transformation the quantitative comparison of brain architecture across different subjects requires a common coordinate system for the analysis of a specific brain area it is necessary to normalize and compare a region of interest and the global brain the intensity based registration method matches the global brain well but a region of interest may not be locally normalized compared to the feature based method the method in this paper uses feature similarities of local regions as well as intensity similarities the lateral ventricle and central gray nuclei of the brain including the corpus callosum which is used for features in schizophrenia detection is appropriately normalized our method reduces the difference of feature areas such as the corpus callosum 77 24 and lateral ventricle 82 135 compared with mutual information and talairach

physiology the diastolic functions of the heart the cardiovascular system was simulated by using an equivalent electronic circuit four sets of simulations were performed the basic variables investigated were cardiac output and stroke volume they were studied as functions i of right ventricular capacitance and negative intrathoracic pressure ii of left ventricular relaxation and of heart rate and iii of left ventricle failure it seems that a satisfactory simulation of systolic and diastolic functions of the heart is possible presented simulations improve our understanding of the role of the capacitance of both ventricles and of the diastolic relaxation in cardiovascular physiology simulation study of the cardiovascular functional status in hypertensive situation an extended cardiovascular model was established based on our previous work to study the consequences of physiological or pathological changes to the homeostatic functions of the cardiovascular system to study hemodynamic changes in hypertensive situations the impacts of cardiovascular parameter variations peripheral vascular resistance arterial vessel wall stiffness and baroreflex gain upon hemodynamics and the shortterm regulation of the cardiovascular system were investigated for the purpose of analyzing baroregulation function the shortterm regulation of arterial pressure in response to moderate dynamic exercise for normotensive and hypertensive cases was studied through computer simulation and clinical experiments the simulation results agree well with clinical data the results of this work suggest that the model presented in this paper provides a useful tool to investigate the functional status of the cardiovascular system in normal or pathological conditions numerical modeling of the flow in stenosed coronary artery the relationship between main hemodynamic parameters the severity of coronary arterial stenosis is usually measured by either simple geometrical parameters such as percent diameter stenosis or hemodynamically based parameters such as the fractional flow reserve ffr or coronary flow reserve cfr the present study aimed to establish a relationship between actual hemodynamic conditions and the parameters that define stenosis severity in the clinical setting we used a computational model of the blood flow in a vessel with a blunt stenosis and an autoregulated vascular bed to simulate a stenosed blood vessel a key point in creating realistic simulations is to properly model arterial autoregulation a constant flow regulation mechanism resulted in cfr and ffr values that were within the physiological range while a constant wallshear stress model yielded unrealistic values the simulation tools developed in the present study may be useful in the clinical assessment of single and multiple stenoses by means of minimally invasive methods a portable auto attendant system with sophisticated dialog structure an attendant system connects the caller to the party heshe wants to talk to traditional systems require the caller to know the full name of the party if the caller forgets the name the system fails to provide service for the caller in this paper we propose a portable auto attendant system aas with sophisticated dialog structure that gives a caller more flexibility while calling the caller may interact with the system to request a phone number by providing just a work area specialty surname or title etc if the party is absent the system may provide extra information such as where he went when he will be back and what he is doing the system is built modularly with components such as speech recognizer language model dialog manager and texttospeech that can be replaced if necessary by simply changing the personnel record database the system can easily be ported to other companies the sophisticated dialog manager applies many strategies to allow natural interaction between user and system functions such as fuzzy request user repairing and extra information query which are not provided by other systems are integrated into our system experimental results and comparisons to other systems show that our approach provides a more user friendly and natural interaction for auto attendant system automated cerebrum segmentation from threedimensional sagittal brain mr images we present a fully automated cerebrum segmentation algorithm for full threedimensional sagittal brain mr images first cerebrum segmentation from a midsagittal brain mr image is performed utilizing landmarks anatomical information and a connectivitybased threshold segmentation algorithm as previously reported recognizing that the cerebrum in laterally adjacent slices tends to have similar size and shape we use the cerebrum segmentation result from the midsagittal brain mr image as a mask to guide cerebrum segmentation in adjacent lateral slices in an iterative fashion this masking operation yields a masked image preliminary cerebrum segmentation for the next lateral slice which may truncate brain regions truncated regions are restored by first finding end points of their boundaries by comparing the mask image and masked image boundaries and then applying a connectivitybased algorithm the resulting final extracted cerebrum image for this slice is then used as a mask for the next lateral slice the algorithm yielded satisfactory fully automated cerebrum segmentations in threedimensional sagittal brain mr images and had performance superior to conventional edge detection algorithms for segmentation of cerebrum from 3d sagittal brain mr images a new method of regression on latent variables application to spectral data several applications are based on the assessment of a linear model linking a set of variables y to a set of predictors x in the presence of strong colinearity among predictors as in the case with spectral data several alternative procedures to ordinary least squares ols are proposed we discuss a new alternative approach which we refer to as regression models through constrained principal components analysis rmcpca this method basically shares certain common characteristics with pls regression as the dependent variables play a central role in determining the latent variables to be used as predictors unlike pls however the approach discussed leads to straightforward models this method also bears some similarity to latent root regression analysis lrr that was discussed by several authors moreover a tuning parameter that ranges between 0 and 1 is introduced and the family of models thus formed includes several other methods as particular cases presentinga better mousetrap leeza outboard video signal processor scaling interlaced video to match

plans for a massive cradletograve electronic records project have been revealed by the government is the scheme really viable hardware and software platform for realtime processing and visualization of echographic radiofrequency signals in this paper the architecture of a hardware and software platform for ultrasonic investigation is presented the platform used in conjunction with an analog frontend hardware for driving the ultrasonic transducers of any commercial echograph having the radiofrequency echo signal access make it possible to dispose of a powerful echographic system for experimenting any processing technique also in a clinical environment in which realtime operation mode is an essential prerequisite the platform transforms any echograph into a testsystem for evaluating the diagnostic effectiveness of new investigation techniques a particular user interface was designed in order to allow a realtime and simultaneous visualization of the results produced in the different stages of the chosen processing procedure this is aimed at obtaining a better optimization of the processing algorithm the most important platform aspect which also constitutes the basic differentiation with respect to similar systems is the direct processing of the radiofrequency echo signal which is essential for a complete analysis of the particular ultrasoundmedia interaction phenomenon the platform completely integrates the architecture of a personal computer pc giving rise to several benefits such as the quick technological evolution in the pc field and an extreme degree of programmability for different applications the pc also constitutes the user interface as a flexible and intuitive visualization support and performs some software signal processing by custom algorithms and commercial libraries the realized close synergy between hardware and software allows the acquisition and realtime processing of the echographic radiofrequency rf signal with fast data

mapping in moving tissue environments a new application of an eigendecompositionbased clutter rejection filter is presented with modifications to deal with high bloodtoclutter ratios bcr additionally a new method for correcting blood velocity estimates with an estimated tissue motion profile is detailed the performance of the clutter filter and velocity estimation strategies is quantified using a

compound imaging for 2d motion vector estimation application to transient elastography this paper describes a new technique for twodimensional 2d imaging of the motion vector at a very high frame rate with ultrasound its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography but beyond this application it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging to date only axial displacements induced in human tissues by lowfrequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography the proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve youngs modulus image reconstruction the process is a combination of several ideas wellknown in ultrasonic imaging ultrafast imaging multisynthetic aperture beamforming 1d speckle tracking and compound imaging classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128 the beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures comparison of successive frames by a classical 1d speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams the variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns fourterminal quantum resistor network for electronwave computing interconnected ultrathin conducting wires or equivalently interconnected quasionedimensional electron waveguides which form a quantum resistor network are presented here in fourterminal configurations the transmission behaviors through such fourterminal networks are evaluated and classified in addition we show that such networks can be used as the basic building blocks for a possible massive wave computing machine in the future in a network each interconnection a node point is an elastic scatterer that routes the electron wave routing and rerouting of electron waves in a network is described in the framework of quantum transport from landauerbuttiker theory in the presence of multiple elastic scatterers transmissions through various types of fourterminal generalized clean aharonovbohm rings are investigated at zero temperature useful logic functions are gathered based on the transmission probability to each terminal with the use of the buttiker symmetry rule in the generalized rings even and odd numbers of terminals can possess some distinctly different transmission characteristics as we have shown here and earlier just as an even or odd number of atoms in a ring is an important quantity for classifying the transmission behavior we show here that whether the number of terminals is an even or an odd number is just as important in understanding the physics of transmission through such a ring furthermore we show that there are three basic classes of fourterminal rings and the scaling relation for each class is provided in particular the existence of equitransmission among all four terminals is shown here this particular physical phenomena cannot exist in any threeterminal ring comparisons and discussions of transmission characteristics between threeterminal and fourterminal rings are also presented the nodeequation approach by considering the kirchhoff current conservation law at each node point is used for this analysis many useful logic functions for electronwave computing are shown here in particular we show that a full adder can be constructed very simply using the equitransmission property of the fourterminal ring this is in sharp contrast with circuits based on transistor logic mathematical properties of dominant ahp and concurrent convergence method this study discusses the mathematical structure of the dominant ahp and the concurrent convergence method which were originally developed by kinoshita and nakanishi they introduced a new concept of a regulating alternative into an analyzing tool for a simple evaluation problem with a criterion set and an alternative set although the original idea of the dominant ahp and the concurrent convergence method is unique the dominant ahp and the concurrent convergence method are not sufficiently analyzed in mathematical theory this study shows that the dominant ahp consists of a pair of evaluation rules satisfying a certain property of overall evaluation vectors this study also shows that the convergence of concurrent convergence method is guaranteed theoretically reaching strong consensus in a general network the strong consensus sc problem is a variant of the conventional distributed consensus problem also known as the byzantine agreement problem the sc problem requires that the agreed value among faultfree processors be one of the faultfree processors initial values originally the problem was studied in a fully connected network with malicious faulty processors in this paper the sc problem is reexamined in a general network in which the components processors and communication links may be subjected to different faulty types simultaneously also called the hybrid fault model or mixed faulty types and the network topology does not have to be fully connected the proposed protocol can tolerate the maximum number of tolerable faulty components such that each faultfree processor obtains a common value for the sc problem in a general network an improved fuzzy mcdm model based on ideal and antiideal concepts liang presented 1999 a fuzzy multiple criteria decision making mcdm method based on the concepts of ideal and antiideal points despite its merits liang method has the following limitations i the objective criteria are converted into dimensionless indices and the subjective criteria are not converted which may prevent compatibility for these criteria ii the formulas for converting objective criteria are not reliable and iii an unreliable ranking method ie maximizing set and minimizing set is applied to rank the fuzzy numbers this paper applies the hsu and chen method and suggests a fuzzy number ranking method to propose an improved fuzzy mcdm model based on ideal and antiideal concepts to overcome the shortcomings of the liang method numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed ranking method and the improved model respectively towards a nmr implementation of a quantum lattice gas algorithm recent theoretical results suggest that an array of quantum information processors communicating via classical channels can be used to solve fluid dynamics problems quantum latticegas algorithms qlga running on such architectures have been shown to solve the diffusion equation and the nonlinear burgers equations in this report we describe progress towards an ensemble nuclear magnetic resonance nmr implementation of a qlga that solves the diffusion equation the methods rely on nmr techniques to encode an initial mass density into an ensemble of twoqubit quantum information processors using standard pulse techniques the mass density can then manipulated and evolved through the steps of the algorithm we provide the experimental results of our first attempt to realize the nmr implementation the results qualitatively follow the ideal simulation but the observed implementation errors highlight the need for improved control quantum computing with spin qubits in semiconductor structures we survey recent work on designing and evaluating quantum computing implementations based on nuclear or boundelectron spins in semiconductor heterostructures at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields general overview is followed by a summary of results of our theoretical calculations of decoherence time scales and spinspin interactions the latter were carried out for systems for which the twodimensional electron gas provides the dominant carrier for spin dynamics via exchange of spinexcitons in the integer quantum hall regime a quantum full adder for a scalable nuclear spin quantum computer we demonstrate a strategy for implementation a quantum full adder in a spin chain quantum computer as an example we simulate a quantum full adder in a chain containing 201 spins our simulations also demonstrate how one can minimize errors generated by nonresonant effects lattice boltzmann schemes for quantum applications we review the basic ideas behind the quantum lattice boltzmann equation lbe and present a few thoughts on the possible use of such an equation for simulating quantum manybody problems on both parallel electronic and quantum computers simulating fermions on a quantum computer the realtime probabilistic simulation of quantum systems in classical computers is known to be limited by the socalled dynamical sign problem a problem leading to exponential complexity in 1981 richard feynman raised some provocative questions in connection to the exact imitation of such systems using a special device named a quantum computer feynman hesitated about the possibility of imitating fermion systems using such a device here we address some of his concerns and in particular investigate the simulation of fermionic systems we show how quantum computers avoid the sign problem in some cases by reducing the complexity from exponential to polynomial our demonstration is based upon the use of isomorphisms of algebras we present specific quantum algorithms that illustrate the main points of our algebraic approach physical quantum algorithms i review the differences between classical and quantum systems emphasizing the connection between nohidden variable theorems and superior computational power of quantum computers using quantum lattice gas automata as examples i describe possibilities for efficient simulation of quantum and classical systems with a quantum computer i conclude with a list of research directions quantum computation for physical modeling one of the most famous american physicists of the twentieth century richard feynman in 1982 was the first to propose using a quantum mechanical computing device to efficiently simulate quantum mechanical manybody dynamics a task that is exponentially complex in the number of particles treated and is completely intractable by any classical computing means for large systems of many particles in the two decades following his work remarkable progress has been made both theoretically and experimentally in the new field of quantum computation critical lines identification on voltage collapse analysis this paper deals with critical lines identification on voltage collapse analysis it is known from the literature that voltage collapse is a local phenomenon that spreads around an initial neighborhood therefore identifying the system critical bus plays an important role on voltage collapse prevention for this purpose the system critical transmission lines should also be identified in this paper these issues are addressed yielding reliable results in a short computational time tests are done with the help of the ieee118 bus and the southeastern brazilian systems permission grids practical errorbounded simplification we introduce the permission grid a spatial occupancy grid which can be used to guide almost any standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm into generating an approximation with a guaranteed geometric error bound in particular all points on the approximation are guaranteed to be within some userspecified distance from the original surface such bounds are notably absent from many current simplification methods and are becoming increasingly important for applications in scientific computing and adaptive level of detail control conceptually simple the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside the volume the permission grid makes three important practical improvements over current errorbounded simplification methods first it works on arbitrary triangular models handling all manners of mesh degeneracies gracefully further the error tolerance may be easily expanded as simplification proceeds allowing the construction of an errorbounded level of detail hierarchy with vertex correspondences among all levels of detail and finally the permission grid has a representation complexity independent of the size of the input model and a small running time overhead making it more practical and efficient than current methods with similar guarantees modeling frequently accessed wireless data with weak consistency to reduce the response times of wireless data access in a mobile network caches are utilized in wireless handheld devices if the original data entry has been updated the cached data in the handheld device becomes stale thus a mechanism is required to predict when the cached copy will expire this paper studies a weakly consistent data access mechanism that computes the timetolive ttl interval to predict the expiration time we propose an analytic model to investigate this ttlbased algorithm for frequently accessed data the analytic model is validated against simulation experiments our study quantitatively indicates how the ttlbased algorithm reduces the wireless communication cost by increasing the probability of stale accesses depending on the requirements of the application appropriate parameter values can be selected based on the guidelines provided the 3d visibility complex visibility problems are central to many computer graphics applications the most common examples include hiddenpart removal for view computation shadow boundaries mutual visibility of objects for lighting simulation in this paper we present a theoretical study of 3d visibility properties for scenes of smooth convex objects we work in the space of light rays or more precisely of maximal free segments we group segments that see the same object this defines the 3d visibility complex the boundaries of these groups of segments correspond to the visual events of the scene limits of shadows disappearance of an object when the viewpoint is moved etc we provide a worst case analysis of the complexity of the visibility complex of 3d scenes as well as a probabilistic study under a simple assumption for normal scenes we extend the visibility complex to handle temporal visibility we give an outputsensitive construction algorithm and present applications of our approach paretooptimal formulations for cost versus colorimetric accuracy tradeoffs in printer color management color management for the printing of digital images is a challenging task due primarily to nonlinear inkmixing behavior and the presence of redundant solutions for print devices with more than three inks algorithms for the conversion of image data to printerspecific format are typically designed to achieve a single predetermined rendering intent such as colorimetric accuracy we present two cielab to cmyk color conversion schemes based on a general paretooptimal formulation for printer color management the schemes operate using a 149color characterization data set selected to efficiently capture the entire cmyk gamut the first scheme uses artificial neural networks as transfer functions between the cielab and cmyk spaces the second scheme is based on a reformulation of tetrahedral interpolation as an optimization problem characterization data are divided into tetrahedra for the interpolationbased approach using the program qhull which removes the common restriction that characterization data be well organized both schemes offer user control over tradeoff problems such as cost versus reproduction accuracy allowing for userspecified print objectives and the use of constraints such as maximum allowable ink and maximum allowable aesub ab a formulation for minimization of ink is shown to be particularly favorable integrating both a clipping and gamut compression features into a single methodology meshed atlases for realtime procedural solid texturing we describe an implementation of procedural solid texturing that uses the texture atlas a onetoone mapping from an objects surface into its texture space the method uses the graphics hardware to rasterize the solid texture coordinates as colors directly into the atlas a texturing procedure is applied perpixel to the texture map replacing each solid texture coordinate with its corresponding procedural solid texture result the procedural solid texture is then mapped back onto the object surface using standard texture mapping the implementation renders procedural solid textures in real time and the user can design them interactively the quality of this technique depends greatly on the layout of the texture atlas a broad survey of texture atlas schemes is used to develop a set of general purpose mesh atlases and tools for measuring their effectiveness at distributing as many available texture samples as evenly across the surface as possible the main contribution of this paper is a new multiresolution texture atlas it distributes all available texture samples in a nearly uniform distribution this multiresolution texture atlas also supports mipmapped minification antialiasing and linear magnification filtering topologyreducing surface simplification using a discrete solid representation this paper presents a new approach for generating coarselevel approximations of topologically complex models dramatic topology reduction is achieved by converting a 3d model to and from a volumetric representation our approach produces valid errorbounded models and supports the creation of approximations that do not interpenetrate the original model either being completely contained in the input solid or bounding it several simple to implement versions of our approach are presented and discussed we show that these methods perform significantly better than other surfacebased approaches when simplifying topologicallyrich models such as scene parts and complex mechanical assemblies keeping web accessibility in mind ir services for all after presenting three compelling reasons for making web sites accessible to persons with a broad range of disabilities its the morally right thing to do its the smart thing to do from an economic perspective and its required by law the author discusses design issues that impact persons with particular types of disabilities she presents practical advice for assessing and addressing accessibility problems an extensive list of resources for further information is appended as is a list of sites which simulate the impact of specific accessibility problems on persons with disabilities disabilityrelated special libraries one of the ways that the federal government works to improve services to people with disabilities is to fund disabilityrelated information centers and clearinghouses that provide information resources and referrals to disabled individuals their family members service providers and the general public the teaching research division of western oregon university operates two federally funded information centers for people with disabilities obirn the oregon brain injury resource network and dblink the national information clearinghouse on children who are deafblind both have developed indepth library collections and services in addition to typical clearinghouse services the authors describe how obirn and dblink were designed and developed and how they are currently structured and maintained both information centers use many of the same strategies and tools in daytoday operations but differ in a number of ways including materials and clientele information access for all meeting the needs of deaf and hard of hearing people discusses the nature of deafness and hearing impairments with particular reference to the impact which the onset of hearing loss presents at various ages the author goes on to present practical tips for interacting with deaf and hard of hearing clients in various communication contexts including sightreading tty communications and asl interpreters an annotated list of suggested readings is appended access to information for blind and visually impaired clients this article guides ir providers in establishing effective communication techniques for working with visually impaired consumers the authors discuss common causes of vision impairment and the functional implications of each and offer information on disability etiquette and effective voice accessible media and inperson communication there is an overview of assistive technologies used by people who are visually impairedto facilitate written and electronic communications as well as lowtech solutions for producing largeprint and braille materials inhouse providers who implement these communication techniques will be well equipped to serve visuallyimpaired consumers and consumers will be more likely to avail themselves of these services when providers make them easily accessible access matters discusses accessibility needs of people with disabilities both from the perspective of getting the information from ir programs including accessible web sites tty access braille and other mechanisms and from the perspective of being aware of accessibility needs when referring clients to resources includes information on ada legislation requiring accessibility to public places and recommends several organizations and web sites for additional information domesticating computers and the internet the people who use computers and the ways they use them have changed substantially over the past 25 years in the beginning highly educated people mostly men in technical professions used computers for work but over time a much broader range of people are using computers for personal and domestic purposes this trend is still continuing and over a shorter time scale has been replicated with the use of the internet the paper uses data from four national surveys to document how personal computers and the internet have become increasingly domesticated since 1995 and to explore the mechanisms for this shift now people log on more often from home than from places of employment and do so for pleasure and for personal purposes rather than for their jobs analyses comparing veteran internet users to novices in 1998 and 2000 and analyses comparing the change in use within a single sample between 1995 and 1996 support two complementary explanations for how these technologies have become domesticated women children and less welleducated individuals are increasingly using computers and the internet and have a more personal set of motives than welleducated men in addition the widespread diffusion of the pc and the internet and the response of the computing industry to the diversity in consumers has led to a rich set of personal and domestic services applying genetic algorithms to solve the fuzzy optimal profit problem this study investigated the application of genetic algorithms in solving a fuzzy optimization problem that arises in business and economics in this problem a fuzzy price is determined using a linear or a quadratic fuzzy demand function as well as a linear cost function the objective is to find the optimal fuzzy profit which is derived from the fuzzy price and fuzzy cost traditional methods for solving this problem are 1 the extension principle and 2 using interval arithmetic and alpha cuts however we argue that traditional methods for solving this problem are too restrictive to produce an optimal solution and that an alternative approach is possibly needed we use genetic algorithms to obtain an approximate solution for this fuzzy optimal profit problem without using membership functions we not only give empirical examples to show the effectiveness of this approach but also give theoretical proofs to validate correctness of the algorithm we conclude that genetic algorithms can produce good approximate solutions when applied to solve fuzzy optimization problems failures and successes notes on the development of electronic cash between 1997 and 2001 two midsized communities in canada hosted north americas most comprehensive experiment to introduce electronic cash and in the process replace physical cash for casual lowvalue payments the technology used was mondex and its implementation was supported by all the countrys major banks it was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market for which the canadian implementation was to serve as a showcase however soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly on the contrary it created a host of controversies in areas as varied as computer security consumer privacy and monetary policy in the following years few of these controversies could be resolved and mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism in 2001 the experiment was finally terminated using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies sts the article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash a new sociotechnical system into the complex setting of the existing payment system the story of mondex not only offers lessons on why technologies fail but also offers insight into how shortterm failures can contribute to longterm transformations this suggests the need to rethink the dichotomy of success and failure icann and internet governance leveraging technical coordination to realize global public policy the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann was created in 1998 to perform technical coordination of the internet icann also lays the foundations for governance creating capabilities for promulgating and enforcing global regulations on internet use icann leverages the capabilities in the internet domain name system dns to implement four mechanisms of governance authority law sanctions and jurisdictions these governancerelated features are embodied in seemingly technical features of icanns institutional design recognition of icanns governance mechanisms allows us to better understand the internets emerging regulatory regime community technology and democratic rationalization the objective of the paper is to explore questions of human agency and democratic process in the technical sphere through the example of virtual community the formation of relatively stable longterm group associations community in the broad sense of the term is the scene on which a large share of human development occurs as such it is a fundamental human value mobilizing diverse ideologies and sensitivities the promise of realizing this value in a new domain naturally stirs up much excitement among optimistic observers of the internet at the same time the eagerness to place hopes for community in a technical system flies in the face of an influential intellectual tradition of technology criticism this eagerness seems even more naive in the light of the recent commercialization of so much internet activity despite the widespread skepticism we believe the growth of virtual community is significant for an inquiry into the democratization of technology we show that conflicting answers to the central question of the present theoretical debate  is community possible on computer networks epsilon neralize from particular features of systems and software prevalent at different stages in the development of computer networking we conclude that research should focus instead on how to design computer networks to better support community activities and values the network society as seen from italy italy was behind the european average in internet development for many years but a new trend which has brought considerable change emerged at the end of 1998 and showed its effects in 2000 and the following years now italy is one of the top ten countries worldwide in internet hostcount and the fourth largest in europe the density of internet activity in italy in proportion to the population is still below the average in the european union but is growing faster than germany the uk and france and faster than the worldwide or european average from the point of view of media control there are several problems italy has democratic institutions and freedom of speech but there is an alarming concentration in the control of mainstream media especially broadcast there are no officially declared restrictions in the use of the internet but several legal and regulatory decisions reveal a desire to limit freedom of opinion and dialogue andor gain centralized control of the net where tech is cheap servers talk consultancy support not tech is the expensive part of network installations

supercompany crm all the thoughts conversations and notes of employees help the firm create a wider picture of business customer relationship management crm feeds on data and it is hungry an efficient and stable ray tracing algorithm for parametric surfaces in this paper we propose an efficient and stable algorithm for finding raysurface intersections newtons method and bezier clipping are adapted to form the core of our algorithm ray coherence is used to find starting points for newton iteration we introduce an obstruction detection technique to verify whether an intersection point found using newtons method is the closest when newtons method fails to achieve convergence we use bezier clipping substitution to find the intersection points this combination achieves a significant improvement in tracing primary rays a similar approach successfully improves the performance of tracing secondary rays data assimilation of local model error forecasts in a deterministic model one of the most popular data assimilation techniques in use today are of the kalman filter type which provide an improved estimate of the state of a system up to the current time level based on actual measurements from a forecasting viewpoint this corresponds to an updating of the initial conditions the standard forecasting procedure is to then run the model uncorrected into the future driven by predicted boundary and forcing conditions the problem with this methodology is that the updated initial conditions quickly washout thus after a certain forecast horizon the model predictions are no better than from an initially uncorrected model this study demonstrates that through the assimilation of error forecasts in the present case made using socalled local models entire model domains can be corrected for extended forecast horizons ie long after updated initial conditions have become washedout thus demonstrating significant improvements over the conventional methodology some alternate uses of local models are also explored for the redistribution of error forecasts over the entire model domain which are then compared with more conventional kalman filter type schemes the rise and fall and rise

online monitoring of motor and generator winding insulation electrical insulation plays a critical role in the operation of motor and generator rotor and stator windings premature failure of the insulation can cost millions of dollars per day with advancements in electronics sensors computers and software tremendous progress has been made in the past 25 yr which has transformed online insulation monitoring from a rarely used and expensive tool to the point where 50 of large utility generators in north america are now equipped for such monitoring this review paper outlines the motivation for online monitoring discusses the transition to todays technology and describes the variety of methods now in use for rotor winding and stator winding monitoring on the discretization of doublebracket flows this paper extends the method of magnus series to liealgebraic equations originating in doublebracket flows we show that the solution of the isospectral flow y  yny yo  ysub 0 in symn can be represented in the form yt  esup omega tysub 0esup  omega 1 where the taylor expansion of omega can be constructed explicitly termbyterm identifying individual expansion terms with certain rooted trees with bicolor leaves this approach is extended to other liealgebraic equations that can be appropriately expressed in terms of a finite alphabet approximation and complexity ii iterated integration for pt i see ibid no 1 p 28995 2001 we introduce two classes of real analytic functions w contained inimplied by u on an interval starting with rational functions to construct functions in w we allow the application of three types of operations addition integration and multiplication by a polynomial with rational coefficients in a similar way to construct functions in u we allow integration addition and multiplication of functions already constructed in u and multiplication by rational numbers thus u is a subring of the ring of pfaffian functions two lower bounds on the lsub infinity norm are proved on a function f from w or from u respectively in terms of the complexity of constructing f quadratic newton iteration for systems with multiplicity newtons iterator is one of the most popular components of polynomial equation system solvers either from the numeric or symbolic point of view this iterator usually handles smooth situations only when the jacobian matrix associated to the system is invertible this is often a restrictive factor generalizing newtons iterator is still an open problem how to design an efficient iterator with a quadratic convergence even in degenerate cases we propose an answer for an madic topology when the ideal m can be chosen generic enough compared to a smooth case we prove quadratic convergence with a small overhead that grows with the square of the multiplicity of the root adaptive wavelet methods ii beyond the elliptic case this paper is concerned with the design and analysis of adaptive wavelet methods for systems of operator equations its main accomplishment is to extend the range of applicability of the adaptive waveletbased method developed previously for symmetric positive definite problems to indefinite or unsymmetric systems of operator equations this is accomplished by first introducing techniques such as the least squares formulation developed previously that transform the original continuous problem into an equivalent infinite system of equations which is now wellposed in the euclidean metric it is then shown how to utilize adaptive techniques to solve the resulting infinite system of equations it is shown that for a wide range of problems this new adaptive method performs with asymptotically optimal complexity ie it recovers an approximate solution with desired accuracy at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of terms in a corresponding waveletbest nterm approximation an important advantage of this adaptive approach is that it automatically stabilizes the numerical procedure so that for instance compatibility constraints on the choice of trial spaces like the lbb condition no longer arise clioweb cliorequest and clio database enhancing patron and staff

taken by the profession of librarianship as a whole recent improvements in technology and a desire to provide better service to students and faculty have resulted in the implementation of ereserves by ever greater numbers of academic libraries yet a great deal of confusion still surrounds the issue of copyright compliance negotiation litigation and legislation in particular have framed the debate over the application of fair use to an ereserves environment and the question of whether or not permission fees should be paid to rights holders but as of yet no definitive answers or standards have emerged the mutual effects of grid and wind turbine voltage stability control this note considers the results of wind turbine modelling and power system stability investigations voltage stability of the power grid with gridconnected wind turbines will be improved by using blade angle control for a temporary reduction of the wind turbine power during and shortly after a short circuit fault in the grid voltage control methods with grid connected wind turbines a tutorial review within electricity grid networks it is conventional for largescale central generators to both provide power and control grid node voltage therefore when wind turbines replace conventional power stations on a substantial scale they must not only generate power but also control grid node voltages this paper reviews the basic principles of voltage control for tutorial benefit and then considers application of gridconnected wind turbines for voltage control the most widely used contemporary wind turbine types are considered and further detail is given for determining the range of variables that allow control active pitch control in larger scale fixed speed horizontal axis wind turbine systems i linear controller design this paper reviews and addresses the principles of linear controller design of the fixed speed wind turbine system in above rated wind speed using pitch angle control of the blades and applying modern control theory first the nonlinear equations of the system are built in under some reasonable suppositions then the nonlinear equations are linearised at set operating point and digital simulation results are shown in this paper finally a linear quadratic optimal feedback controller is designed and the dynamics of the closed circle system are simulated with digital calculation the advantages and disadvantages of the assumptions and design method are also discussed because of the inherent characteristics of the linear system control theory the performance of the linear controller is not sufficient for operating wind turbines as is discussed flow measurement  future directions interest in the flow of liquids and its measurement can be traced back to early studies by the egyptians the chinese and the romans since these early times the science of flow measurement has undergone a massive change but during the last 25 years or so 19772002 it has matured enormously one of the principal reasons for this is that higher accuracies and reliabilities have been demanded by industry in the measurement of fiscal transfers and today there is vigorous interest in the subject from both the flowmeter manufacturer and user viewpoints this interest is coupled with the development of advanced computer techniques in fluid mechanics together with the application of increasingly sophisticated electronics integrated optical metrology controls post etch cds control of the transistor gate critical dimension cd on the order of a few nanometers is a top priority in many advanced ic fabs each nanometer deviation from the target gate length translates directly into the operational speed of these devices however using inline process control by linking the lithography and etch tools can improve cd performance beyond what each individual tool can achieve the integration of optical cd metrology tools to etch mainframes can result in excellent etcher stability and better control of postetch cds a novel control logic for fast valving operations this letter proposes new control logic for operating parallel valves in fast valving schemes in order to improve the transient stability performance of power systems a fast valving scheme using parallel valves overcomes many of the limitations of the conventional scheme the proposed control logic for operating these valves has been applied to a typical single machine infinite bus system single as well as multiple stroke operations for controlling the turbine power output have been studied with the new control sequences encouraging results have been shown over the conventional schemes of fast valving edisons direct current influenced broadway show lighting during the early decades of the 20 th century midtown manhattan in new york city developed an extensive underground direct current dc power distribution system this was a result of the original introduction of direct current by thomas edisons pioneering pearl street station in 1882 the availability of dc power in the theater district led to the perpetuation of an archaic form of stage lighting control through nearly threequarters of the 20 th century this control device was known as a resistance dimmer it was essentially a seriesconnected rheostat but it was wound with a special resistance taper so as to provide a uniform change in the apparent light output of typical incandescent lamps throughout the travel of its manually operated arm the development and use of dc powered stage lighting is discussed in this article a scalable and efficient systolic algorithm for the longest common subsequence problem a longest common subsequence lcs of two strings is a common subsequence of two strings of maximal length the lcs problem is that of finding an lcs of two given strings and the length of the lcs this problem has been the subject of much research because its solution can be applied in many areas in this paper a scalable and efficient systolic algorithm is presented for two given strings of length m and n where morn the algorithm can solve the lcs problem in m2r1 respectively n2r1 time steps with rn2 respectively rm2 processors experimental results show that the algorithm can be faster on multicomputers than all the previous systolic algorithms for the same problem oracles suite grows up once a

generalized gaussian quadratures for exponentials and their applications we introduce new families of gaussiantype quadratures for weighted integrals of exponential functions and consider their applications to integration and interpolation of bandlimited functions we use a generalization of a representation theorem due to caratheodory to derive these quadratures for each positive measure the quadratures are parameterized by eigenvalues of the toeplitz matrix constructed from the trigonometric moments of the measure for a given accuracy epsilon  selecting an eigenvalue close to epsilon yields an approximate quadrature with that accuracy to compute its weights and nodes we present a new fast algorithm these new quadratures can be used to approximate and integrate bandlimited functions such as prolate spheroidal wave functions and essentially bandlimited functions such as bessel functions we also develop for a given precision an interpolating basis for bandlimited functions on an interval a framework for image deblurring using wavelet packet bases we show that the average over translations of an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis is a convolution we also show that an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis can be decomposed into several operators of the same kind each of them being better conditioned we investigate the possibility of using such a convolution to approximate a given convolution in practice an image blur then we use these approximations to deblur images first we show that this framework permits us to redefine existing deblurring methods then we show that it permits us to define a new variational method which combines the wavelet packet and the total variation approaches we argue and show by experiments that this permits us to avoid the drawbacks of both approaches which are respectively ringing and staircasing the canonical dual frame of a wavelet frame we show that there exist wavelet frames that have nice dual wavelet frames but for which the canonical dual frame does not consist of wavelets ie cannot be generated by the translates and dilates of a single function accelerating filtering techniques for numeric csps search algorithms for solving numeric csps constraint satisfaction problems make an extensive use of filtering techniques in this paper we show how those filtering techniques can be accelerated by discovering and exploiting some regularities during the filtering process two kinds of regularities are discussed cyclic phenomena in the propagation queue and numeric regularities of the domains of the variables we also present in this paper an attempt to unify numeric csps solving methods from two distinct communities that of csp in artificial intelligence and that of interval analysis summarization beyond sentence extraction a probabilistic approach to sentence compression when humans produce summaries of documents they do not simply extract sentences and concatenate them rather they create new sentences that are grammatical that cohere with one another and that capture the most salient pieces of information in the original document given that large collections of textabstract pairs are available online it is now possible to envision algorithms that are trained to mimic this process in this paper we focus on sentence compression a simpler version of this larger challenge we aim to achieve two goals simultaneously our compressions should be grammatical and they should retain the most important pieces of information these two goals can conflict we devise both a noisychannel and a decisiontree approach to the problem and we evaluate results against manual compressions and a simple baseline clausal resolution in a logic of rational agency a resolution based proof system for a temporal logic of possible belief is presented this logic is the combination of the branchingtime temporal logic ctl representing change over time with the modal logic kd45 representing belief such combinations of temporal or dynamic logics and modal logics are useful for specifying complex properties of multiagent systems proof methods are important for developing verification techniques for these complex multimodal logics soundness completeness and termination of the proof method are shown and simple examples illustrating its use are given local search with constraint propagation and conflictbased heuristics search algorithms for solving csp constraint satisfaction problems usually fall into one of two main families local search algorithms and systematic algorithms both families have their advantages designing hybrid approaches seems promising since those advantages may be combined into a single approach in this paper we present a new hybrid technique it performs a local search over partial assignments instead of complete assignments and uses filtering techniques and conflictbased techniques to efficiently guide the search this new technique benefits from both classical approaches a priori pruning of the search space from filteringbased search and possible repair of early mistakes from local search we focus on a specific version of this technique tabu decisionrepair experiments done on openshop scheduling problems show that our approach competes well with the best highly specialized algorithms bitserial absup 2 multiplier using modified inner product this paper presents a new multiplication algorithm and based on this algorithm proposes a hardware architecture called modified innerproduct multiplier mipm which computes absup 2 multiplication based on a linear feedback shift register lfsr the algorithm is based on the property of the irreducible all one polynomial aop over the finite field gf2sup m the proposed architecture reduces the time and space complexity for computing absup 2 the proposed architecture has a potential application to implementing exponentiation architecture for a publickey cryptosystem yet some more complexity results for default logic we identify several new tractable subsets and several new intractable simple cases for reasoning in the propositional version of reiters default logic the majority of our findings are related to brave reasoning by making some intuitive observations most classes that we identify can be derived quite easily from some subsets of default logic already known in the literature some of the subsets we discuss are subclasses of the socalled extended logic programs all the tractable subsets presented in this paper can be recognized in linear time

exclusive to the fatpipe superhighway estimation of thermal coefficients of magnetooptical media previously we described a method for estimating the thermal conductivity of magnetooptic recording media the method relies on identifying the laser power that brings the maximum temperature of the tbfeco layer to as high as the curie temperature we extensively use a similar method to estimate the heat capacity of a dielectric layer a tbfeco layer and an aluminum alloy layer of magnetooptic recording media measurements are conducted on static disks with a beam of light focused on a tbfeco layer

involve distributed control if communication is required among different types of agents especially when mobile agents can migrate from station to station this technique can be implemented in a distributed distance learning environment which allows students or instructors to login from anywhere to a central server in an education center while still retaining the lookandfeel of personal

education users instructors students and system administrators we propose an agent communication framework as well as agent evolution states of mobile agents the communication architecture and message

not well documented women have played an important role in the development of computer science a survey of women pioneers demonstrates their influence in designing and programming the first electronic computers and languages while laying the groundwork for womens expanding involvement in science recruitment and retention of women graduate students in computer science and engineering results of a workshop organized by the computing research association this document is the report of a workshop that convened a group of experts to discuss the recruitment and retention of women in computer science and engineering cse graduate programs participants included longtime members of the cse academic and research communities social scientists engaged in relevant research and directors of successful retention efforts the report is a compendium of the experience and expertise of workshop participants rather than the result of a fullscale scholarly study into the range of issues its goal is to provide departments with practical advice on recruitment and retention in the form of a set of specific recommendations ten suggestions for a genderequitable cs classroom though considerable attention has been paid to the creation of a nurturing environment for women in the field of computer science proposed solutions have primarily focused on activities outside of the classroom this paper presents a list of suggestions for modifications to both the pedagogy and content of cs courses designed to make the cs classroom environment more inviting for women students pool halls chips and war games women in the culture of computing computers are becoming ubiquitous in our society and they offer superb opportunities for people in jobs and everyday life but there is a noticeable sex difference in use of computers among children this article asks why computers are more attractive to boys than to girls and offers a cultural framework for explaining the apparent sex differences although the data are fragmentary the world of computing seems to be more consistent with male adolescent culture than with feminine values and goals furthermore both arcade and educational software is designed with boys in mind these observations lead us to speculate that computing is neither inherently difficult nor uninteresting to girls but rather that computer games and other software might have to be designed differently for girls programs to help teachers instill computer efficacy in all children also need to be developed women in computing what brings them to it what keeps them in it career stereotyping and misperceptions about the nature of computing are substantive reasons for the under representation of women in professional computing careers in this study 15 women who have work experience in several aspects of computing were asked about their reasons for entering computing what they liked about working in computing and what they disliked while there are many common threads there are also individual differences common reasons for choosing computing as a career included exposure to computing in a setting which enabled them to see the versatility of computers the influence of someone close to them personal abilities which they perceived to be appropriate for a career in computing and characteristics of such careers which appealed to them generally women working in the field enjoy the work they are doing dislikes arising from their work experiences are more likely to be associated with people and politics than with the work they doand they would like to have more female colleagues efficient cellular automata based versatile multiplier for gf2sup m in this paper a lowcomplexity programmable cellular automata pca based versatile modular multiplier in gf2sup m is presented the proposed versatile multiplier increases flexibility by using the same multiplier in different security environments and it reduces the users cost moreover the multiplier can be easily extended to high order of m for more security and lowcost serial implementation is feasible in restricted computing environments such as smart cards and wireless devices gender benders women in computing profession as a minority in the upper levels of the computing profession women are sometimes mistreated through ignorance or malice some women have learned to respond with wit and panache becoming a computer scientist the focus of this report is pipeline shrinkage for women in computer science we describe the situation for women at all stages of training in computer science from the precollege level through graduate school because many of the problems discussed are related to the lack of role models for women who are in the process of becoming computer scientists we also concern ourselves with the status of women faculty members we not only describe the problems but also make specific recommendations for change and encourage further study of those problems whose solutions are not yet well understood the incredible shrinking pipeline we look at the harsh facts concerning the percentage of degrees awarded in cs to women we study the trend of degrees awarded in cs since 1980 and compare the trend in cs to other science and engineering disciplines we consider the relationship between the percentage of degrees awarded to women by a cs department and the college the cs department is within we find that cs departments in engineering colleges graduate on average proportionately fewer women than cs departments in nonengineering colleges we request that the community respond to the facts and speculations presented in this article an acmw literature review on women in computing the pipeline shrinkage problem for women in computer science is a wellknown and documented phenomenon where the ratio of women to men involved in computing shrinks dramatically from early student years to working years during the last decade considerable research ensued to understand the reasons behind the existence of the shrinking pipeline and in some cases to take action to increase the numbers of women in computing through the work of a national science foundation funded project acms committee on women in computing acmw has taken a first step towards pulling this research together a large number of articles was gathered and processed on the topic of women in computing and the shrinking pipeline the committee created a publicly available online database to organize the references of this body of work by topic author and reference information the database constantly being updated is accessible through acmws website httpwwwacmorgwomen a final report is also available via the acmw web site which covers current statistics on women in computing summaries of the literature in the database and a set of recommendations the article is a brief synopsis of a subset of the literature review as of august 2001 women in computing history exciting inventions innovative technology human interaction and intriguing politics fill computing history however the recorded history is mainly composed of male achievements and involvements even though women have played substantial roles this situation is not unusual most science fields are notorious for excluding undervaluing or overlooking the accomplishments of their female scientists as lee points out it is up to the historians and others to remedy this imbalance steps have been taken towards this goal through publishing biographies on women in technology and through honoring the pioneers with various awards such as the ghc97 pioneering awards the witi hall of fame and the awc lovelace award a few online sites contain biographies of women in technology however even with these resources many women who have contributed significantly to computer science are still to be discovered gender software design and occupational equity after reviewing the work on gender bias in software design a model of genderrole influenced achievement choice taken from eccles 1994 is presented the paper concludes that 1 though laudable reduction of gender bias in software design is not the most straightforward way to reduce gender inequity in the choice of computing as a career 2 the model itself makes more clear some of the ethical issues involved in attempting to achieve gender equity on computing and 3 efforts to reduce gender inequity in the choice of computing as a career need to be evaluated in the light of this model female computer science doctorates what does the survey of earned doctorates reveal based on the national center for education statistics 2000 in the 19971998 academic year 267 of earned bachelors degrees 290 of earned masters degrees and 163 of earned doctorates degrees in computer science were awarded to women as these percentages suggest women are underrepresented at all academic levels in computer science camp 1997 the most severe shortage occurs at the top levelthe doctorate in computer science we know very little about the women who persist to the top level of academic achievement in computer science this paper examines a subset of data collected through the survey of earned doctorates sed the specific focus of this paper is to identify trends that have emerged from the sed with respect to females completing doctorates in computer science between the academic years 19901991 and 19992000 although computer science doctorates include doctorates in information science prior research camp 1997 suggests that the percentage of women completing doctorates in information science as compared to computer science is low the specific research questions are 1 how does the percentage of women who complete doctorates in computer science compare to those that complete doctorates in other fields 2 how does the length of time in school and the sources of funding differ for females as compared to males who complete doctorates in computer science 3 where do women go after completing doctorates in computer science and what positions do they acquire how do these experiences differ from their male peers a gendered view of computer professionals preliminary results of a survey the underrepresentation of women in the computing profession in many parts the western world has received our attention through numerous publications the noticeable low representation of women at computer science conferences and in the lecture halls over the past two decades the situation had become worse this paper seeks to add to the dialogue by presenting preliminary findings from a research project conducted in four countries the aim of this research was to gain an insight into the perceptions future computer professionals hold on the category of employment loosely defined under the term of a computer professional one goal was to get insight into whether or not there is a difference between female and mate students regarding their view of computer professionals other goals were to determine if there was any difference between female and male students in different parts of the world as well as who or what most influences the students to undertake their courses in computing women in computing around the world this paper describes the participation of women in computing in more than 30 countries by focussing on participation at undergraduate level a brief discussion covers how societal and cultural factors may affect womens participation statistics from many different sources are presented for comparison generally participation is low  most countries fall in the 1040 range with a few below 10 and a few above 40 ten years of strategies to increase participation of women in computing programs the central queensland university experience 19992001 in the late eighties the participation rate of women in information technology courses in most australian universities was around 25 this low level of womens participation in computing courses occurs not only in australia but also overseas more studies indicate that the participation rates have not improved and in fact may be even further in decline participation rates in the workforce also appear to be in decline concerned at the imbalance within australia the federal government directed all australian universities to increase the number of women in courses leading to a professional computing qualification ie information technology courses to 40 of students by 1995 this paper details one australian universitys approach over a 10 year period 19912001 to redress this imbalance we provide examples of intervention strategies developed and the outcomes for these strategies we present the outcomes against a background frame of the australian higher education scene of that decade which was influenced by funding levels to universities in general and to equity programs in particular we present data related to the participation of women in computing programs along with snapshots of the overall changing student demographics over this period strategic implementation of itis projects in construction a case study the need for improved implementation of information technology it and information systems is has been emphasised in both empirical and prescriptive research studies this problem is magnified in the construction industry which has been slow to embrace and utilise new technologies with negative consequences on productivity and innovation this paper presents a strategic implementation framework for itis projects in construction the framework builds upon recent published works and encompasses welldocumented predictors for effective itis implementation a case study with a large multinational construction organisation is used to demonstrate the strategic implementation of a project management information system pmis used for the construction of a mobile phone telecommunications network in the south east of queensland australia encouraging women in computer science at a cost to both their own opportunities and societys ability to produce people with muchneeded technical skills women continue to be underrepresented in computer science degree programs at both the undergraduate and graduate level although some of the barriers that women face have their foundations in cultural expectations established well before the college level we believe that departments can take effective steps to increase recruitment and retention of women students this paper describes several strategies we have adopted at stanford over the past decade unlocking the clubhouse the carnegie mellon experience in the fall of 1995 just seven of 95 students entering the undergraduate program in computer science at carnegie mellon university were women in 2000 54 of 130 or 42 were women what happened this article presents a brief history of the transformation at carnegie mellons school of computer science and the research project that lay behind it building an effective computer science student organization the carnegie mellon womenscs action plan this paper aims to provide a practical guide for building a student organization and designing activities and events that can encourage and support a community of women in computer science this guide is based on our experience in building womenscs a community of women in the school of computer science scs at carnegie mellon university rather than provide an abstract todo or mustdo list we present a sampling of concrete activities and events in the hope that these might suggest possibilities for a likeminded student organization however since we have found it essential to have a core group of activist students at the helm we provide a todo list of features that we feel are essential for forming supporting and sustaining creative and effective student leadership virtual development center the virtual development center of the institute for women and technology seeks to significantly enhance the impact of women on technology it addresses this goal by increasing the number of women who have input on created technology enhancing the ways people teach and develop technology and developing needbased technology that serves the community through activities of the virtual development center a pattern is emerging regarding how computing technologies do or do not satisfy the needs of community groups particularly those communities serving women this paper describes the virtual development center program and offers observations on the impact of computing technology on nontechnical communities a conferences impact on undergraduate female students in september of 2000 the 3rd grace hopper celebration of women in computing was held in cape cod massachusetts along with a colleague from a nearby university we accompanied seven of our female undergraduate students to this conference this paper reports on how the conference experience immediately affected these students  what impressed them what scared them what it clarified for them it also reports on how the context in which these students currently evaluate their ability potential and opportunity in computer science is different now from what it was before the conference hopefully by understanding their experience we can gain some insight into things we can do for all of our undergraduate female students to better support their computer science and engineering education support communities for women in computing this article highlights the many activities provided by the support communities available for women in computing thousands of women actively participate in these programs and they receive many benefits including networking and professional support in addition the organizations and associations help promote the accomplishments of women computer scientists and disseminate valuable information this article surveys some of these organizations and concludes with a list of suggestions for how faculty members can incorporate the benefits of these organizations in their own institutions people who make a difference mentors and role models the literature of gender issues in computing steadfastly and uniformly has advocated the use of mentors and role models mrm for recruiting and retaining women in computer science this paper therefore accepts the results of research studies and avoids reiterating details of the projects but offers instead a practical guide for using mrm to recruit and retain women in computer science the guide provides pragmatic advice describing several different facets of the mrm concept leveraging an alternative source of computer scientists reentry programs much has been written about the leaky pipeline of women in computer science cs with the percentage of women decreasing as one moves from lower levels such as college to higher levels culminating in full professorship while significant attention focused on keeping women from leaving the pipeline there is also an opportunity to bring women into the pipeline through nontraditional programs instead of requiring that everyone enter at the undergraduate level both mills college a small liberal arts institution for women and uc berkeley a large research university established programs in the 80s to increase the number of women in computer science by tapping nontraditional students both programs share the core value of accommodating older students lacking technical backgrounds the two programs have produced similar results graduate degrees earned in computer science by students who would not have qualified without these programs professional employment in the computer science field by women and minorities and a recognition that this population represents a rich source of talent for our nation recruiting and retaining women in undergraduate computing majors this paper recommends methods for increasing female participation in undergraduate computer science the recommendations are based on recent and ongoing research into the gender gap in computer science and related disciplines they are intended to work in tandem with the computing research associations recommendations for graduate programs to promote a general increase in womens participation in computing professions most of the suggestions offered could improve the educational environment for both male and female students however general improvements are likely to be of particular benefit to women because women in our society do not generally receive the same level of support that men receive for entering and persisting in this field developing a hardware and programming curriculum for middle school girls techbridge provides experiences and resources that would teach girls technology skills as well as excite their curiosity and build their confidence funded by the national science foundation and sponsored by chabot space and science center in oakland california techbridge is a threeyear program that serves approximately 200 girls annually techbridge is hosted at 8 middle and high schools in oakland and at the california school for the blind in fremont california generally as an afterschool program meeting once a week techbridge comes at a critical time in girls development when girls have many important decisions to make regarding classes and careers but often lack the confidence and guidance to make the best choices techbridge helps girls plan for the next steps to high school and college with its role models and guidance techbridge also provides training and resources for teachers counselors and families laserbased internal profile measurement system an automatic laserbased system to measure the internal profiles of various structures has been developed the system uses a point laser source through a rotating optical device fixed on to a laser measurement meter a notebook computer with custom software is used to control the laser meter and rotating device to estimate the scanned profile shape and to determine the resulting crosssection area the information provided by this system is essential to construction industry including window and door builders the glass panel board and floor tile manufacturers carpet venders and building contractors for cost estimation and production control as a result the lead time for delivering the customized windowpanes woodwork floor tiles and ceilings can be reduced applications of this system for measuring the shapes of window frames and floor plans are described and demonstrated the measurement accuracy is evaluated and analyzed results have indicated that the measurement accuracy can be achieved within 4 of the measurement distance for typical window designs and floor patterns required by major window manufacturers recommendations to improve the system are also included virtual family an approach to introducing java programming this paper introduces and discusses virtual family vf a genderneutral gamebased software that introduces java programming vf provides a completely functioning game that students extend and enhance via programming we discuss the background and context within which virtual family was developed and other available multimedia resources for teaching programming the paper then goes on to describe virtual familys concept and design finally feedback received from virtual family teaching workshops is related as well as preliminary results from using vf in highschool teaching units virtual family is under development in a research lab at the university of british columbia and is an initiative of supporting women in information technology swift swift is a fiveyear research action and implementation project to increase the participation of women in information technology the decision procedure for profitability of investment projects using the internal rate of return of singleperiod projects the internal rate of return irr criterion is often used to evaluate profitability of investment projects in this paper we focus on a singleperiod project which consists of two types of cash flows an investment at one period and a return at a succeeding period and a financing at one period and a repayment at a succeeding period we decompose the given investment project into a series of the singleperiod projects from the viewpoint of the singleperiod project we point out the applicability issue of the irr criterion namely the irr criterion cannot be applied in which a project is composed of both investment type and financing type investigating the properties of a series of the singleperiod projects we resolve the applicability issue of the irr criterion and propose the decision procedure for profitability judgment toward any type of investment project based on the comparison between the irr and the capital cost we develop a new algorithm to obtain the value of the project investment rate pir for the given project which is a function of the capital cost only using the standard irr computing routine this outcome is a theoretical breakthrough to widen the utilization of irr in practical applications two efficient algorithms for the generalized maximum balanced flow problem minoux 1976 considered the maximum balanced flow problem ie the problem of finding a maximum flow in a twoterminal network n  va with source s and sink t satisfying the constraint that any arcflow of n is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value from s to t where v is vertex set and a is arc set as a generalization we focus on the problem of maximizing the total flow value of a generalized flow in n with gains gamma a  0 a in a where any arcflow is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value where gamma afa units arrive at the vertex w for each arcflow fa a identical to  upsilon  w in a entering vertex upsilon in a generalized flow our main results are to propose two polynomial algorithms for this problem the first algorithm runs in ommn m b log b time where b is the maximum absolute value among integral values used by an instance of the problem and mn m b denotes the complexity of solving a generalized maximum flow problem in a network with n vertices and m arcs and a rational instance expressed with integers between 1 and b in the second algorithm using a parameterized technique runs in omn m bsup 2 time a scanlinebased algorithm for the 2d freeform bin packing problem this paper describes a heuristic algorithm for the 2d freeform bin packing 2dfbp problem given a set of 2d freeform bins and a set of 2d freeform items the 2dfbp problem is to lay out items inside one or more bins in such a way that the number of bins used is minimized and for each bin the yield is maximized the proposed algorithm handles the problem as a variant of the 1d problem ie items and bins are approximated as sets of scanlines and scanlines are packed the details of the algorithm are given and its application to a nesting problem in a shipbuilding company is reported the proposed algorithm consists of the basic and the group placement algorithms the basic placement algorithm is a variant of the firstfit decreasing algorithm which is simply extended from the 1d case to the 2d case by a novel scanline approximation a numerical study with real instances shows that the basic placement algorithm has sufficient performance for most of the instances however the group placement algorithm is required when items must be aligned in columns the qualities of the resulting layouts are good enough for practical use and the processing times are good valuing corporate debt the effect of crossholdings of stock and debt we have developed a simple approach to valuing risky corporate debt when corporations own securities issued by other corporations we assume that corporate debt can be valued as an option on corporate business asset value and derive payoff functions when there exist crossholdings of stock or debt between two firms next we show that payoff functions with multiple crossholdings can be solved by the contraction principle the payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company crossholdings first the modiglianimiller theorem can obtain when there exist crossholdings between firms second by establishing crossshareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the others firm so that both firms can decrease credit risks by crossshareholdings in the numerical examples we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by crossholdings of stock using monte carlo simulation moreover we show we can calculate the default spread easily when complicated crossholdings exist and find which shares are beneficial or disadvantageous setup cost and lead time reductions on stochastic inventory models with a service level constraint the stochastic inventory models analyzed in this paper explore the problem of lead time associated with setup cost reductions for the continuous review and periodic review inventory models for these two models with a mixture of backorders and lost sales we respectively assume that their mean and variance of the lead time demand and protection interval ie lead time plus review period demand are known but their probability distributions are unknown we develop a minimax distribution free procedure to find the optimal solutionfor each case adjointbased optimization of steady suction for disturbance control in incompressible flows the optimal distribution of steady suction needed to control the growth of single or multiple disturbances in quasithreedimensional incompressible boundary layers on a flat plate is investigated the evolution of disturbances is analysed in the framework of the parabolized stability equations pse a gradientbased optimization procedure is used and the gradients are evaluated using the adjoint of the parabolized stability equations apse and the adjoint of the boundary layer equations able the accuracy of the gradient is increased by introducing a stabilization procedure for the pse results show that a suction peak appears in the upstream part of the suction region for optimal control of tollmienschlichting ts waves steady streamwise streaks in a twodimensional boundary layer and oblique waves in a quasithreedimensional boundary layer subject to an adverse pressure gradient the mean flow modifications due to suction are shown to have a stabilizing effect similar to that of a favourable pressure gradient it is also shown that the optimal suction distribution for the disturbance of interest reduces the growth rate of other perturbations results for control of a steady crossflow mode in a threedimensional boundary layer subject to a favourable pressure gradient show that not even large amounts of suction can completely stabilize the disturbance tracking control of the flexible slidercrank mechanism system under impact the variable structure control vsc and the stabilizer design by using the pole placement technique are applied to the tracking control of the flexible slidercrank mechanism under impact the vsc strategy is employed to track the crank angular position and speed while the stabilizer design is involved to suppress the flexible vibrations simultaneously from the theoretical impact consideration three approaches including the generalized momentum balance gmb the continuous force model cfm and the cfm associated with the effective mass compensation emc are adopted and are derived on the basis of the energy and impulsemomentum conservations simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the motorcontroller flexible slidercrank mechanism not only accomplishing good tracking trajectory of the crank angle but also eliminating vibrations of the flexible connecting rod two quantum analogues of fisher information from a large deviation viewpoint of quantum estimation we discuss two quantum analogues of the fisher information the symmetric logarithmic derivative fisher information and kubomoribogoljubov fisher information from a large deviation viewpoint of quantum estimation and prove that the former gives the true bound and the latter gives the bound of consistent superefficient estimators as another comparison it is shown that the difference between them is characterized by the change of the order of limits an exactly solvable random satisfiability problem we introduce a new model for the generation of random satisfiability problems it is an extension of the hypersat model of riccitersenghi weigt and zecchina 2001 which is a variant of the famous ksat model it is extended to qstate variables and relates to a different choice of the statistical ensemble the model has an exactly solvable statistic the critical exponents and scaling functions of the satunsat transition are calculable at zero temperature with no need of replicas also with exact finitesize corrections we also introduce an exact duality of the model and show an analogy of thermodynamic properties with the random energy model of disordered spin system theory relations with error correcting codes are also discussed positional control of pneumatic manipulators for construction tasks this paper describes solutions that can be applied to pneumatic manipulator problems in positioning both for angle trajectories and for long linear trajectories used in construction tasks optimal positioning of a pneumatic manipulator along angle trajectories with minimum control energy consumption is given the implementation of the control system is presented control algorithms for a long linear trajectory manipulator based on twophase and threephase motion modes of the endeffector are investigated conventional and fuzzy logic controls of a pneumatic manipulator were applied and experimental testing was carried out the obtained results allow widening the application range of pneumatic manipulators in construction particularly in gantry type machines speaker identification from voice using neural networks the paper provides three different schemes for speaker identification of personnel from their voice using artificial neural networks the first scheme recognizes speakers by employing the classical backpropagation algorithm pretrained with known voice samples of the persons the second scheme provides a framework for classifying the known training samples of the voice features using a hierarchical architecture realized with a selforganizing feature map neural net the first scheme is highly robust as it is capable of identifying the personnel from their noisy voice samples but because of its excessive training time it has limited applications for a large voice database the second scheme though not so robust as the former however can classify an unknown voice sample to its nearest class the time needed for classification by the first scheme is always unique irrespective of the voice sample it is proportional to the number of feedforward layers in the network the timerequirement of the second classification scheme however is not free from the voice features and is proportional to the number of 2d arrays traversed by the algorithm on the hierarchical structure the third scheme is highly robust and misclassification is as low as 02 per cent the third scheme combines the composite benefits of a radial basis function neural net and backpropagation trained neural net priming the pipeline women in computer science careers in 1997 the backyard project a pilot program of the garnett foundation was instituted to encourage high school girls to explore careers in the computer industry at that time the garnett foundation commissioned the global strategy group to execute a survey of 652 collegebound high school students grades 9 through 12 to help discover directions that the backyard project might take to try to move toward the mission of the pilot program it conducted the study by telephone between march 25 and april 8 1997 in the silicon valley boston and austin metropolitan areas it conducted all interviews using a random digit dialing methodology derived from a file of american households with high incidences of adolescent children the top six answers from girls to the survey question why are girls less likely to pursue computer science careers in order of perceived importance by the girls were not enough role models women have other interests didnt know about the industry limited opportunity negative media and too nerdy these responses are discussed shortchanging the future of information technology the untapped resource building on ideas from a virtual workshop and additional input from the scientific community the cise directorate at the national science foundation established the information technology workforce program itwf in march 2000 to support a broad set of scientific research studies focused on the underrepresentation of women and minorities in the information technology workforce in this paper we explore various approaches that the funded researchers are taking to address the problem of women in information technology we begin with a brief history of the itwf and then focus on some of the research projects in terms of their goals approaches and expected outcomes programmatic efforts encouraging women to enter the information technology workforce for over a decade the national science foundation nsf has been supporting projects designed to improve opportunities for women in computing from an initial emphasis on increasing the number of women in graduate school studying computer science and engineering nsfs current emphasis has broadened to include research studies examining the underlying reasons why women are underrepresented in the information technology it workforce this paper describes the recent history of nsfs activities in this area and the subsequent emergence of a research portfolio addressing the underrepresentation issue the curious ways of professional cultures and the twobody opportunity when two professionals are a couple we sometimes refer to them as having a twobody problem however when each partner of a couple exists in the same cultures they also have an opportunity for deeply shared understanding and empathy simply because each understands at a deep level the culture in which the other works i explore this notion a couple has what we call the twobody problem when both are professionals who are qualified for a kind of position that is relatively rare and who are very selective about the positions that they accept for example there are relatively scant numbers of jobs as a computer science professorat any level an individual considering an academic job may only be interested in research universities or in teaching universities restricting the choice of open positions substantially the classic twobody problem arises when one partner wants to accept a new position that requires geographical relocation then the other partner also needs to find a new position moreover it can be very difficult to find a suitable position when they are naturally scarce women of color in computing it is well known that there is a need to increase the number of women in the area of computing that is in computer science and computer engineering if we consider women of color that is women of underrepresented ethnicities we find the numbers are very dismal the goal of this article is to bring to light the unique issues of women of color based upon the personal experience of one africanamerican woman who has been in the field of computing for over 20 years including the years of higher education perspectives on academic vs industry environments for women in computer science the authors were tenure track faculty members at the colorado school of mines and later moved into senior positions at software companies both are part of twocareer couples as well and both have two children in this article they discuss their impressions and share anecdotes regarding the differing experiences of women and families in these two environments what do you say open letters to women considering a computer science major in the last decade we have both monitored with great interest the ratio of female to male computer science majors at our respective institutions with each entering class we think surely now is the time when the numbers will become more balanced logic tells us that this must eventually happen because the opportunities in computing are simply too attractive for an entire segment of our population to routinely pass up but each year we are again disappointed in the number of women students as they continue to be woefully underrepresented among computer science majors so what do you say to a young woman who is considering a college choice and a choice of major in order to make computer science a more attractive option we have organized some thoughts on that subject into open letters girls boys and computers today north american girls boys teachers and parents frequently regard computer science and programming as something boys are better at the author considers how many of the factors that contribute to the low participation of women in computing occur first and perhaps most forcefully in childhood she presents four recommendations to address the situation well behaved women rarely make history the author considers women in the history of computer science prior to the eniac women were extremely important to the computing business as computers just as women had taken over the tasks as secretaries in the late 1800s with the advent of the typewriter and in the early 1900s staffing telephone exchanges so computing relied on women as the workhorses of the business planning linear construction projects automated method for the generation of earthwork activities earthworks planning for road construction projects is a complex operation and the planning rules used are usually intuitive and not well defined an approach to automate the earthworks planning process is described and the basic techniques that are used are outlined a computerbased system has been developed initially to help planners use existing techniques more efficiently with their input the system has been extended to incorporate a knowledge base and a simulation of the earthworks processes as well as creating activity sets in a much shorter time the system has shown that for a real project the model is able to generate activity sets that are comparable to those generated by a project planner computing 2002 democracy education and the future computer scientists computer engineers information technologists and their collective products have grown and changed in quantity quality and nature in the first decade of this new century it should become apparent to everyone that the computing and information fields broadly defined will have a profound impact on every element of every persons life the author considers how women and girls of the world have been neither educated for computing nor served by computing globally womens participation in computer science grew for a while then dropped precipitously computing science engineering and society will suffer if this decline continues because women have different perspectives on technology what it is important for how it should be built which projects should be funded and so on to create a positive future to assure that women equally influence the future computing education must change is diversity in computing a moral matter we have presented an ethical argument that takes into consideration the subtleties of the issue surrounding underrepresentation in computing we should emphasize that there is nothing subtle about overt unfair discrimination where such injustice occurs we condemn it our concern is that discrimination need not be explicit or overt it need not be individualtoindividual rather it can be subtly built into social practices and social institutions our analysis raises ethical questions about aspects of computing that drive women away aspects that can be changed in ways that improve the profession and access to the profession we hope that computing will move towards these improvements on md1 queue with deterministic server vacations we study a single server vacation queue with poisson arrivals deterministic service of constant duration b  0 and deterministic vacations of constant duration d  0 and designate this model as mdd1 after completion of each service the server may take a vacation with probability p or may continue working in the system with probability 1  p we obtain timedependent as well as steady state probability generation functions for the number in the system for the steady state we obtain explicitly the mean number and the mean waiting time for the system and for the queue all known results of the md1 queue are derived as a special case finally a numerical illustration is discussed on conflictfree executions of elementary nets deals with analysis of elementary petri nets with respect to possibilities of avoiding conflicts during their executions there are two main aims of the paper the first is to find a method of checking if a net is conflictavoidable ie if it possesses a conflictfree fair run the second is to find a method of rebuilding any net to a totally conflictavoidable net ie a net possessing a conflictfree fair run in every one process with the same behaviour the main results are the following 1 the proof of decidability for elementary nets of the problem of existence of a conflictavoidable fair process and an algorithm producing all fair runs 2 construction for an arbitrary given elementary net of a totally conflictavoidable net with the same behaviour the net completed this way has the same behaviour as the original one moreover it is totally conflictavoidable and its execution may be supervised in order to ensure conflictfreeness by the reduced case graph built by the algorithm of the former section a hybridneural network and population learning algorithm approach to solving reliability optimization problem proposes a hybrid approach integrating a dedicated artificial neural network and population learning algorithm applied to maximising system reliability under cost and technical feasibility constraints the paper includes a formulation of the system reliability optimisation sro problem and a description of the dedicated neural network trained by applying the population learning algorithm a solution to the example sro problem is shown and results of the computational experiment are presented and discussed assignment of periods and priorities of messages and tasks in distributed control systems presents a task and messagebased scheduling method to guarantee the given endtoend constraints including precedence constraints time constraints and period and priority of task and message the method is an integrated one considering both tasks executed in each node and messages transmitted via the network and is designed to apply to a general distributed control system that has multiple loops and a single loop has sensor nodes with multiple sensors actuator nodes with multiple actuators controller nodes with multiple tasks and several types of constraints the assigning method of the optimal period and priority of task and message is proposed using the presented task and messagebased scheduling method a fractionalflow model of serial manufacturing systems with rework and its reachability and controllability properties a dynamic fractionalflow model of a serial manufacturing system incorporating rework is considered using some results on reachability and controllability of positive linear systems the ability of serial manufacturing systems with rework to move in space that is their reachability and controllability properties are studied these properties are important not only for optimising the performance of the manufacturing system possibly offline but also to improve its functioning by using feedback control online towards strong stability of concurrent repetitive processes sharing resources the paper presents a method for design of stability conditions of concurrent repetitive processes sharing common resources steadystate behaviour of the system with m cyclic processes utilising a resource with the mutual exclusion is considered based on a recurrent equations framework necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of maximal performance steadystate are presented it was shown that if the conditions hold then the mprocess system is marginally stable ie a steadystate of the system depends on the perturbations the problem of finding the relative positions of the processes leading to waitingfree maximal efficiency steadystates of the system is formulated as a constraint logic programming problem an example illustrating the solving of the problem for a 3process system using objectoriented constraint logic programming language oz is presented a condition sufficient for strong stability of the mprocess system is given when the condition holds then for any initial phases of the processes a waitingfree steadystate will be reached storage functionals and lyapunov functions for passive dynamical systems for nonlinear timeinvariant inputoutput dynamical systems the passivity conditions are obtained under some restrictions the conditions imply storage functions satisfying a dissipation inequality a class of storage functions allowing unique reconstruction of a passive dynamical system is defined these results are illustrated by an example of a linear system with fading memory an important for practical application class of the linear relaxation systems without direct inputoutput interaction is considered a necessary condition for dynamical systems to be of the relaxation type is obtained for this class the condition is connected with the existence of a unique quadratic lyapunov function satisfying the complete monotonicity condition this unique lyapunov function corresponds to a standard thermodynamic potential in a compact family of potentials in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics the results obtained can be useful in automatic control mechanics of viscoelastic materials and various applications in physics and the system theory synthesis of the control systems via reflection onto auxiliary surfaces an approach to robust control systems synthesis both linear and nonlinear and nonstationary is offered the control is carried out providing the given phase constraints varied in acceptable limits in view of constraints on its value and incompleteness of the information about functioning disturbances the approach is based on the introduction of auxiliary integral surfaces on which the initial moving is projected as a result the reduced equivalent moving is formed being described by the scalar equation which in many important cases can be integrated directly on the basis of the equation obtained solving a synthesis task is carried out and can be reduced to algebraic or integral inequalities the final relations defined for linear equivalent moving are presented a framework for rapid local area modeling for construction automation rapid 3d positioning and modeling in construction can be used to more effectively plan visualize and communicate operations before execution it can also help to optimize equipment operations significantly improve safety and enhance a remote operators spatial perception of the workspace a new framework for rapid local area sensing and 3d modeling for better planning and control of construction equipment operation is described and demonstrated by combining humanassisted graphical workspace modeling with prestored computeraided design cad models and simple sensors such as singleaxis laser rangefinders and remote video cameras modeling time can be significantly reduced while potentially increasing modeling accuracy multiple criteria decision making without optimization we present a development intended to make interactive decision making schemes accessible for a wider spectrum of decision makers to this aim we propose to eliminate the need to solve optimization problems at successive iterations of interactive decision processes we show that the need for optimization can be eliminated by the ability of establishing sufficiently tight bounds on criteria values for efficient decisions prior to explicit identification of such decisions we present a technique fully operational and numerically simple for establishing such bounds bounds are dynamic ie they become stronger with the growing number of decisions explicitly identified they are also parametric with respect to weighting coefficients we also point out how this technique can enhance the existing interactive decision making methods establishing the discipline of physicsbased cmp modeling for the past decade a physically based comprehensive process model for chemical mechanical polishing has eluded the semiconductor industry however a longterm collaborative effort has now resulted in a workable version of that approach the highly fundamental model is based on advanced finite element analysis and is beginning to show promise in cmp process development dementing disorders volumetric measurement of cerebrospinal fluid to distinguish normal from pathologic finding  feasibility study we have demonstrated that automated methods to describe the severity and distribution of cerebral atrophy are capable of providing diagnostic information in the classification of neurodegenerative diseases use of natural language processing to translate clinical information from a database of 889921 chest radiographic reports the aim was to evaluate translation of chest radiographic reports using natural language processing and to compare the findings with those in the literature a natural language processor coded 10 years of narrative chest radiographic reports from an urban academic medical center coding for 150 reports was compared with manual coding frequencies and cooccurrences of 24 clinical conditions diseases abnormalities and clinical states were estimated the ratio of right to left lung mass association of pleural effusion with other conditions and frequency of bullet and stab wounds were compared with independent observations the sensitivity and specificity of the systems pneumothorax coding were compared with those of manual financial coding internal and external validation in this study confirmed the accuracy of natural language processing for translating chest radiographic narrative reports into a large database of information improved detection of lung nodules by using a temporal subtraction technique the authors evaluated the effect of a temporal subtraction technique for digital chest radiography with regard to the accuracy of detection of lung nodules twenty solitary lung nodules smaller than 30 mm in diameter including 10 lung cancers and 10 benign nodules were used the nodules were grouped subjectively according to their subtlety for nonnodular cases 20 nodules without perceptible interval changes were selected all chest radiographs were obtained by using a computed radiographic system and temporal subtraction images were produced by using a program developed at the university of chicago the effect of the temporal subtraction image was evaluated by using an observer performance study with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis observer performance with temporal subtraction images was substantially improved asub z  0980 and 0958 as compared with that without temporal subtraction images asub z  0920 and 0825 for the certified radiologists and radiology residents respectively the temporal subtraction technique clearly improved diagnostic accuracy for detecting lung nodules especially subtle cases in conclusion the temporal subtraction technique is useful for improving detection accuracy for peripheral lung nodules on digital chest radiographs algorithms for improving the quality of rtrees a novel approach to operation with a structure for spatial indexing of extended objects shaped as rtrees is considered it consists of the initial global construction of an efficient rtree structure and the subsequent operation with it using conventional dynamic algorithms a global strategy for constructing an rtree reduced to a problem of dividing a set of rectangular objects into k parts with minimum mutual overlay is suggested base box and divide and conquer algorithms are suggested the results of experimental modeling of the execution of various algorithms are discussed calculation of

advertising expenses mathematical model of functioning of an insurance company with allowance for advertising expenses a mathematical model of the functioning of an insurance company with allowance for advertising expenses is suggested the basic characteristics of the capital of the company and the advertising efficiency are examined in the case in which the advertising expenses are proportional to the capital achieving competitive capabilities in eservices what implications does the internet have for service operations strategy how can business performance of eservice companies be improved in todays knowledgebased economy these research questions are the subject of the paper we propose a model that links the eservice companys knowledgebased competencies with their competitive capabilities drawing from the current literature our analysis suggests that services that strategically build a portfolio of knowledgebased competencies namely human capital structural capital and absorptive capacity have more operationsbased options than their counterparts who are less apt to invest we assume that the combinative capabilities of service quality delivery flexibility and cost are determined by the investment in intellectual capital arguably with the advent of the internet different operating models eg bricksandmortar clicksandmortar or pure dotcom have different strategic imperatives in terms of knowledgebased competencies thus the new eoperations paradigm can be viewed as a configuration of knowledgebased competencies and capabilities lanbased building maintenance and surveillance robot the building and construction industry is the major industry of hong kong as in many developed countries around the world after the commissioning of a highrise building or a large estate substantial manpower both inside the management centre under a standby manner as well as surveillance for security purposes around the whole building is required for daily operation to ensure a quality environment for the occupants if the surveillance job can be done by robots the efficiency can be highly enhanced resulting in a great saving of manpower and the improved safety of the management staff as a byproduct furthermore if the robot can retrieve commands from the building management system via a local area network lan further savings in manpower can be achieved in terms of firstline fault attendance by human management staff this paper describes the development of a robot prototype here in hong kong which can handle some daily routine maintenance works and surveillance responsibilities the hardware structure of the robot and its onboard devices are described realtime images captured by a camera on the robot with pantiltzoom functions can be transmitted back to the central management office via a local area network the interface between the robot and the building automation system bas of the building is discussed this is the first key achievement of this project with a strong implication on reducing the number of human staff to manage a modem building teleoperation of the robot via the internet or intranet is also possible which is the second achievement of this project finally the robot can identify its physical position inside the building by a landmark recognition method based on standard cad drawings which is the third achievement of this project the main goal of this paper is not the description of some groundbreaking technology in robotic development it is mainly intended to convince building designers and managers to incorporate robotic systems

service class of asynchronous transfer mode networks uses a feedback control mechanism to adapt to varying link capacities the virtual sourcevirtual destination vsvd technique offers the possibility of segmenting the otherwise endtoend abr control loop into separate loops the improved feedback delay and control of abr traffic inside closed segments provide a better performance for abr connections this article presents the use of classical linear control theory to model and develop an abr vsvd flow control algorithm discrete event simulations are used to analyze the behavior of the algorithm with respect to transient behavior and correctness of the control model linear control theory offers the means to derive correct choices of parameters and to assess performance issues such as stability of the system during the design phase the performance goals are high link utilization fair bandwidth distribution and robust operation in various environments which are verified by discrete event simulations the major contribution of this work is the use of analytic methods linear control theory to model and design an abr flow control algorithm tailored for the special layout of a vsvd switch and the use of simulation techniques to verify the result modeling and simulation of adaptive available bit rate voice over asynchronous transfer mode networks this article presents a modeling and simulation methodology to analyze the performance of voice quality when sent over the available bit rate service in asynchronous transfer mode networks sources can modify the rate at which they send traffic to the network based on the feedback carried in the resource management cells this is achieved by changing the encoding level as the contention increases to network resourcesbandwidth in this casesources start reducing the rate at which they generate and send traffic the efficiency of the scheme under different schedulingdrop policies and other operating conditions and environments is evaluated using simulation modeling furthermore sensitivity analysis is applied to different parameters such as queue size and averaging interval length to investigate their impact on the performance metrics results show that limiting the load to 41 of the link capacity results in an acceptable quality ultrahigh speed positioning control of a gravure engraving unit using a discretetime twodegreeoffreedom hsub infinity  control the piezoelectric actuator has highspeed response in comparison with the electromagnetic actuator however it is not easy to achieve both highspeed and highprecision response by feedforward control only because the piezoelectric element has nonlinear properties such as the hysteresis effect thus feedback control is required to achieve good performance we develop a control design method to achieve both highspeed and highprecision response for piezoelectric actuators using the discretetime hsub infinity  control method and the twodegreeoffreedom control scheme the effectiveness of our proposed method has been shown by simulation and experimental results the most important contribution of our study is that our method can be directly applied to commercial machines highperformance servo systems based on multirate sampling control in this paper novel multirate twodegreeoffreedom controllers are proposed for digital control systems in which the sampling period of plant output is restricted to be relatively longer than the control period of plant input the proposed feedforward controller assures perfect tracking at m intersampling points on the other hand the proposed feedback controller assures perfect disturbance rejection at m intersample points in the steady state illustrative examples of position control for hard disk drive are presented and advantages of these approaches are demonstrated development of an integrated and openarchitecture precision motion control system in this paper the development of an integrated and openarchitecture precision motion control system is presented the control system is generally applicable but it is developed with a particular focus on direct drive servo systems based on linear motors the overall control system is comprehensive comprising of various selected control and instrumentation components integrated within a configuration of hardware architecture centred around a dspace ds1004 dsp processor board these components include a precision composite controller comprising of feedforward and feedback control a disturbance observer an adaptive notch filter and a geometrical error compensator the hardware architecture software development platform user interface and all constituent control components are described multivariable hsub infinity  mu feedback

feasible procedure is presented to design mimo feedback controllers for electromechanical positioning devices using hsub infinity  mu techniques weighting filters are proposed to straightforwardly and effectively impose performance and uncertainty specifications experiments show that mimo control can considerably improve upon the performance with multiloop siso control some problems are highlighted that are important for industrial practice but lacking a workable solution influence of the process design on the control strategy application in electropneumatic field this article proposes an example of electropneumatic system where the architecture of the process is modified with respect to both the specifications for position and velocity tracking and a criterion concerning the energy

monovariable and multivariable type based on the flatness theory it challenge cross selling finance like most financial institutions fleetboston fidelity and berkshire group of companies are being charged with developing a strong technology platform that will allow them to cross sell their products and services they discuss their solutions advice and technology choices control of a heavyduty robotic excavator using time delay control with integral sliding surface the control of a robotic excavator is difficult from the standpoint of the following problems parameter variations in mechanical structures various nonlinearities in hydraulic actuators and disturbance due to the contact with the ground in addition the more the size of robotic excavators increases the more the length and mass of the excavator links the more the parameters of a heavyduty excavator vary a timedelay control with switching action tdcsa using an integral sliding surface is proposed in this paper for the control of a 21ton robotic excavator through analysis and experiments we show that using an integral sliding surface for the switching action of tdcsa is better than using a pdtype sliding surface the proposed controller is applied to straightline motions of a 21ton robotic excavator with a speed level at which skillful operators work experiments which were designed for surfaces with various inclinations and over broad ranges of joint motions show that the proposed controller exhibits good performance scheduling schemes for an integrated flight and propulsion control system we describe two schemes for scheduling an integrated flight and propulsion control system for an experimental verticalshort takeoff and landing vstol aircraft concept in the acceleration from hover 0120 kn flight phase multivariable integrated flight and propulsion controllers are designed at several points over the vstol envelope and implemented as exact plant observers with state feedback in the first scheduling scheme the values of the state feedback and observer gain matrices are interpolated between the fixedpoint designs as a function of aircraft speed in the second approach the control signals produced by the different fixedpoint controllers are blended allowing a significant reduction in the order of the scheduled controllers both scheduling schemes are shown in nonlinear simulation to provide excellent handling qualities as the aircraft accelerates from the hover greybox model identification via evolutionary computing this paper presents an evolutionary greybox model identification methodology that makes the best use of a priori knowledge on a clearbox model with a global structural representation of the physical system under study whilst incorporating accurate blackbox models for immeasurable and local nonlinearities of a practical system the evolutionary technique is applied to building dominant structural identification with local parametric tuning without the need of a differentiable performance index in the presence of noisy data it is shown that the evolutionary technique provides an excellent fitting performance and is capable of accommodating multiple objectives such as to examine the relationships between model complexity and fitting accuracy during the model building process validation results show that the proposed method offers robust uncluttered and accurate models for two practical systems it is expected that this type of greybox models will accommodate many practical engineering systems for a better modelling accuracy control of a coupled map lattice model for vortex shedding in the wake of a cylinder the flow behind a vibrating flexible cable at low reynolds numbers can exhibit complex wake structures such as lacelike patterns vortex dislocations and frequency cells these structures have been observed in experiments and numerical simulations and are predicted by a previously developed loworder coupled map lattice cml the discrete in time and space cml models consist of a series of diffusively coupled circle map oscillators along the cable span motivated by a desire to modify the complex wake patterns behind flexible vibrating cables we have studied the addition of control terms into the highly efficient cml models and explored the resulting dynamics proportional adaptive proportional and discontinuous nonlinear dnl control methods were used to derive the control laws the first method employed occasional proportional feedback the adaptive method used spatiotemporal feedback control the dnl method used a discontinuous feedback linearization procedure and the controller was designed for the resulting linearized system using eigenvalue assignment these techniques were applied to a modeled vortex dislocation structure in the wake of a vibrating cable in uniform freestream flow parallel shedding patterns were achieved for a range of forcing frequencyforcing amplitude combinations studied to validate the control theory the adaptive proportional and dnl methods were found to be more effective than the proportional control method due to the incorporation of a spatially varying feedback gain across the cylinder span the dnl method was found to be the most efficient controller of the loworder cml model the required control level across the cable span was correlated to the 11 lockon behavior of the temporal circle map a knowledge management framework for the support of decision making in humanitarian assistancedisaster relief the major challenge in current humanitarian assistancedisaster relief hadr efforts is that diverse information and knowledge are widely distributed and owned by different organizations these resources are not efficiently organized and utilized during hadr operations we present a knowledge management framework that integrates multiple information technologies to collect analyze and manage information and knowledge for supporting decision making in hadr the framework will help identify the information needs be aware of a disaster situation and provide decisionmakers with useful relief recommendations based on past experience a comprehensive consistent and authoritative knowledge base within the framework will facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse this framework can also be applied to other similar realtime decisionmaking environments such as crisis management and emergency medical assistance a meteorological fuzzy expert system incorporating subjective user input we present a fuzzy expert system medex for forecasting galeforce winds in the mediterranean basin the most successful local wind forecasting in this region is achieved by an expert human forecaster with access to numerical weather prediction products that forecasters knowledge is expressed as a set of rulesofthumb fuzzy set methodologies have proved well suited for encoding the forecasters knowledge and for accommodating the uncertainty inherent in the specification of rules as well as in subjective and objective input medex uses fuzzy set theory in two ways as a fuzzy rule base in the expert system and for fuzzy pattern matching to select dominant wind circulation patterns as one input to the expert system the system was developed tuned and verified over a twoyear period during which the weather conditions from 539 days were individually analyzed evaluations of medex performance for both the onset and cessation of winter and summer winds are presented and demonstrate that medex has forecasting skill competitive with the us navys regional forecasting center in rota spain attribute generation based on association rules a decision tree is considered to be appropriate 1 if the tree can classify the unseen data accurately and 2 if the size of the tree is small one of the approaches to induce such a good decision tree is to add new attributes and their values to enhance the expressiveness of the training data at the data preprocessing stage there are many existing methods for attribute extraction and construction but constructing new attributes is still an art these methods are very time consuming and some of them need a priori knowledge of the data domain they are not suitable for data mining dealing with large volumes of data we propose a novel approach that the knowledge on attributes relevant to the class is extracted as association rules from the training data the new attributes and the values are generated from the association rules among the originally given attributes we elaborate on the method and investigate its feature the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through some experiments efficient transitive closure reasoning in a combined classpartcontainment hierarchy class hierarchies form the backbone of many implemented knowledge representation and reasoning systems they are used for inheritance classification and transitive closure reasoning part hierarchies are also important in artificial intelligence other hierarchies eg containment hierarchies have received less attention in artificial intelligence this paper presents an architecture and an implementation of a hierarchy reasoner that integrates a class hierarchy a part hierarchy and a containment hierarchy into one structure in order to make an implemented reasoner useful it needs to operate at least at speeds comparable to human reasoning as realworld hierarchies are always large special techniques need to be used to achieve this we have developed a set of parallel algorithms and a data representation called maximally reduced tree cover for that purpose the maximally reduced tree cover is an improvement of a materialized transitive closure representation which has appeared in the literature our experiments with a medical vocabulary show that transitive closure reasoning for combined classpartcontainment hierarchies in near constant time is possible for a fixed hardware configuration schema evolution in data warehouses we address the issues related to the evolution and maintenance of data warehousing systems when underlying data sources change their schema capabilities these changes can invalidate views at the data warehousing system we present an approach for dynamically adapting views according to schema changes arising on source relations this type of maintenance concerns both the schema and the data of the data warehouse the main issue is to avoid the view recomputation from scratch especially when views are defined from multiple sources the data of the data warehouse is used primarily in organizational decisionmaking and may be strategic therefore the schema of the data warehouse can evolve for modeling new requirements resulting from analysis or datamining processing our approach provides means to support schema evolution of the data warehouse independently of the data sources agents in ecommerce state of the art this paper surveys the state of the art of agentmediated electronic commerce

microstructures the model is based on the finite element method with periodic boundary conditions the voronoi algorithm is used to generate the geometrical model which has a periodic grain structure that follows the original boundaries of the voronoi cells as an application the model is used to model a twophase ferritepearlite steel it is shown that periodic cells with only five grains generate

engineering is defined on complexly shaped domains quite often multiply connected generation of quality finite element meshes on such domains especially in cases when the mesh must be 100 quadrilateral is highly problematic this paper describes mathematical fundamentals and practical implementation of a powerful method and algorithm allowing transformation of multiply connected domains of arbitrary geometrical complexity into a set of simple domains the latter can then be processed by broadly available finite element mesh generators the developed method was applied to a number of complex geometries including those arising in analysis of parasitic inductances and capacitances in printed circuit boards the quality of practical results produced by the method and its programming implementation provide evidence that the algorithm can be applied to other finite element models with various physical backgrounds smart collision information processing sensors for fast moving objects in this technical note we survey the area of smart collision information processing sensors we review the existing technologies to detect collision or overlap between fast moving physical objects or objects in virtual environments physical environments or a combination of physical and virtual objects we report developments in the collision detection of fast moving objects at discrete time steps such as two consecutive time frames as well as continuous time intervals such as in an interframe collision detection system our discussion of computational techniques in this paper is limited to convex objects techniques exist however to efficiently decompose nonconvex objects into convex objects we also discuss the tracking technologies for objects from the standpoint of collision detection or avoidance design and manufacture of a lightweight piezocomposite curved actuator in this paper we are concerned with the design manufacture and performance test of a lightweight piezocomposite curved actuator called lipca using a top carbon fiber composite layer with nearzero coefficient of thermal expansion cte a middle pzt ceramic wafer and a bottom glassepoxy layer with a high cte the main point of the design for lipca is to replace the heavy metal layers of thunder tm by lightweight fiber reinforced plastic layers without losing the capabilities for generating high force and large displacement it is possible to save up to about 40 of the weight if we replace the metallic backing material by the light fiber composite layer we can also have design flexibility by selecting the fiber direction and the size of prepreg layers in addition to the lightweight advantage and design flexibility the proposed device can be manufactured without adhesive layers when we use an epoxy resin prepreg system glassepoxy prepregs a ceramic wafer with electrode surfaces and a carbon prepreg were simply stacked and cured at an elevated temperature 177 degrees c after following an autoclave bagging process we found that the manufactured composite laminate device had a sufficient curvature after being detached from a flat mould an analysis method using the classical lamination theory is presented to predict the curvature of lipca after curing at an elevated temperature the predicted curvatures are in quite good agreement with the experimental values in order to investigate the merits of lipca performance tests of both lipca and thunder tm have been conducted under the same boundary conditions from the experimental actuation tests it was observed that the developed actuator could generate larger actuation displacement than thunder tm dynamic testing of inflatable structures using smart materials in this paper we present experimental investigations of the vibration testing of an inflated thinfilm torus using smart materials lightweight inflatable structures are very attractive in satellite applications however the lightweight flexible and highly damped nature of inflated structures poses difficulties in ground vibration testing in this study we show that polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf patches and recently developed macrofiber composite actuators may be used as sensors and actuators in identifying modal parameters both smart materials can be integrated unobtrusively into the skin of a torus or space device forming an attractive testing arrangement the addition of actuators and pvdf sensors to the torus does not significantly interfere with the suspension modes of a freefree boundary condition and can be considered an integral part of the inflated structure the results indicate the potential of using smart materials to measure and control the dynamic response of inflated structures a fundamental investigation into large strain recovery of oneway shape memory alloy wires embedded in flexible polyurethanes shape memory alloys smas are being embedded in or externally attached to smart structures because of the large amount of actuation deformation and force that these materials are capable of producing when they are heated previous investigations have focused primarily on using single or opposing sma wires exhibiting the twoway shape memory effect sme because of the simplicity with which the repeatable actuation behavior of the structure can be predicted this repeatable actuation behavior is achieved at the expense of reduced levels of recoverable deformation alternatively many potential smart structure applications will employ multiple sma wires exhibiting a permanent oneway sme to simplify fabrication and increase the recoverable strains in the structure to employ the oneway wires it is necessary to investigate how they affect the recovery of large strains when they are embedded in a structure in this investigation the large strain recovery of a oneway sma wire embedded in a flexible polyurethane is characterized using the novel deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation these results are compared with a simple actuation model and a threedimensional finite element analysis of the structure using the brinson model for describing the thermomechanical behavior of the sma results indicate that the level of actuation strain in the structure is substantially reduced by the inelastic behavior of the oneway sma wires and there are significant differences between the deformations of the matrix material adjacent to the sma wires and in the region surrounding it the transformation behavior of the sma wires was also determined to be volume preserving which had a significant effect on the transverse strain fields experimental investigation of active vibration control using neural networks and piezoelectric actuators the use of neural networks for identification and control of smart structures is investigated experimentally piezoelectric actuators are employed to suppress the vibrations of a cantilevered plate subject to impulse sine wave and bandlimited white noise disturbances the neural networks used are multilayer perceptrons trained with error backpropagation validation studies show that the identifier predicts the system dynamics accurately the controller is trained adaptively with the help of the neural identifier experimental results demonstrate excellent closedloop performance and robustness of the neurocontroller autonomous detection of crack initiation using surfacemounted piezotransducers in this paper we report on the application of an in situ health monitoring system comprising an array of piezoceramic wafer elements to the detection of fatigue degradation in metallic specimens exposed to cyclic loading lamb waves transmitted through a beam test coupon are sensed using small surfacemounted piezotransducer elements and the signals are then autonomously analysed for indications relating to the onset of structural degradation the experimental results confirm the efficacy of the approach and provide a demonstration of good robustness under realistic loading conditions emphasizing the great potential for developing an automated in situ structural health monitoring system for application to fatigueprone operational structures such as aircraft weighted energy linear quadratic regulator vibration control of piezoelectric composite plates in this paper on finite element linear quadratic regulator lqr vibration control of smart piezoelectric composite plates we propose the use of the total weighted energy method to select the weighting matrices by constructing the optimal performance function as a relative measure of the total kinetic energy strain energy and input energy of the system only three design variables need to be considered to achieve a balance between the desired higher damping effect and lower input cost modal control analysis is used to interpret the effects of three energy weight factors on the damping ratios and modal voltages and it is shown that the modal damping effect will increase with the kinetic energy weight factor approaching square root 22 as the strain energy weight factor increases and decrease with the input energy weight factor numerical results agree well with those from the modal control analysis since the control problem is simplified to three design variables only the computational cost will be greatly reduced and a more accurate structural control analysis becomes more attractive for large systems closed loop finiteelement modeling of active constrained layer damping in the time domain analysis a threedimensional finiteelement closedloop model has been developed to predict the effects of activepassive damping on a vibrating structure the gollahughesmctavish method is employed to capture the viscoelastic material behavior in a time domain analysis the parametric study includes the different control gains as well as geometric parameters related to the active constrained layer damping acld treatment comparisons are made among several acld models the passive constrained model and the active damping model the results obtained here reiterate that acld is somewhat better for vibration suppression than either the purely passive or the active system and provides higher structural damping with less control gain when compared to the purely active system since the acld performance can be reduced by the viscoelastic layer the design of the acld model must be given a careful consideration in order to optimize the effect of passive damping helpdesk support is key to wireless success finance a well thought out help desk can make or break an institutions mobile play schwab ameritrade and rbc are taking their support function seriously narxbased technique for the modelling of magnetorheological damping devices this paper presents a methodology for identifying variablestructure nonlinear models of magnetorheological dampers mrd and similar devices its peculiarity with respect to the mainstream literature is to be especially conceived for obtaining models that are structurally simple easy to estimate and well suited for modelbased control this goal is pursued by adopting linearintheparameters narx models for which an identification method is developed based on the minimization of the simulation error this method is capable of selecting the model structure together with the parameters thus it does not require a priori structural information a set of validation tests is reported with the aim of demonstrating the techniques efficiency by comparing it to a widely accepted mrd modelling approach active vibration control of composite sandwich beams with piezoelectric extensionbending and shear actuators we have used quasistatic equations of piezoelectricity to derive a finite element formulation capable of modelling two different kinds of piezoelastically induced actuation in an adaptive composite sandwich beam this formulation is made to couple certain piezoelectric constants to a transverse electric field to develop extensionbending actuation and shearinduced actuation as an illustration we present a sandwich model of three sublaminates facecoreface we develop a control scheme based on the linear quadratic regulatorindependent modal space control lqrimsc method and use this to estimate the active stiffness and the active damping introduced by shear and extensionbending actuators to assess the performance of each type of actuator a dynamic response study is carried out in the modal domain we observe that the shear actuator is more efficient in actively controlling the vibration than the extensionbending actuator for the same control effort modeling of torsional vibration induced by extensiontwisting coupling of anisotropic composite laminates with piezoelectric actuators in this paper we present a dynamic analytical model for the torsional vibration of an anisotropic piezoelectric laminate induced by the extensiontwisting coupling effect in the present approach we use the hamilton principle and a reduced bending stiffness method for the derivation of equations of motion as a result the inplane displacements are not involved and the outofplane displacement of the laminate is the only quantity to be calculated therefore the proposed method turns the twisting of a laminate with structural coupling into a simplified problem without losing its features we give analytical solutions of the present model with harmonic excitation a parametric study is performed to demonstrate the present approach realtime estimations of multimodal frequencies for smart structures in this paper various methods for the realtime estimation of multimodal frequencies are realized in real time and compared through numerical and experimental tests these parameterbased frequency estimation methods can be applied to various engineering fields such as communications radar and adaptive vibration and noise control wellknown frequency estimation methods are introduced and explained the bairstow method is introduced to find the roots of a characteristic equation for estimations of multimodal frequencies and the computational efficiency of the bairstow method is shown quantitatively for a simple numerical test we consider two sinusoids of the same amplitudes mixed with various amounts of white noise the test results show that the auto regressive ar and auto regressive and moving average arma methods are unsuitable in noisy environments the other methods apart from the ar method have fast tracking capability from the point of view of computational efficiency the results reveal that the arma method is inefficient while the cascade notch filter method is very effective the linearized adaptive notch filter and recursive maximum likelihood methods have average performances experimental tests are devised to confirm the feasibility of realtime computations and to impose the severe conditions of drastically different amplitudes and of considerable changes of natural frequencies we have performed experiments to extract the natural frequencies from the vibration signal of winglike composite plates in real time the natural frequencies of the specimen are changed by added masses especially the ar method exhibits a remarkable performance in spite of the severe conditions this study will be helpful to anyone who needs a frequency estimation algorithm for realtime applications inducedshear piezoelectric actuators for rotor blade trailing edge flaps much of the current rotorcraft research is focused on improving performance by reducing unwanted helicopter noise and vibration one of the most promising active rotorcraft vibration control systems is an active trailing edge flap in this paper an inducedshear piezoelectric tube actuator is used in conjunction with a simple levercusp hinge amplification device to generate a useful combination of trailing edge flap deflections and hinge moments a finiteelement model of the actuator tube and trailing edge flap including aerodynamic and inertial loading was used to guide the design of the actuatorflap system a fullscale induced shear tube actuator flap system was fabricated and bench top testing was conducted to validate the analysis hinge moments corresponding to various rotor speeds were applied to the actuator using mechanical springs the testing demonstrated that for an applied electric field of 3 kv cmsup 1 the tube actuator deflected a representative fullscale 12 inch flap or28 degrees at 0 rpm and or14 degrees for a hinge moment simulating a 400 rpm condition the per cent error between the predicted and experimental fullscale flap deflections ranged from 4 low rpm to 125 large rpm increasing the electric field to 4 kv cmsup 1 results in or25 degrees flap deflection at a rotation speed of 400 rpm according to the design analysis a trade study was conducted to compare the performance of the piezoelectric tube actuator to the state of the art in trailing edge flap actuators and indicated that the inducedshear tube actuator shows promise as a trailing edge flap actuator experimental feedforward and feedback control of a onedimensional sma composite the control of embedded shape memory alloy sma actuators has recently become a topic of interest in the field of smart structures the inherent difficulties associated with sma actuators has resulted in a variety of approaches homogenization provides a simplified yet mathematically rigorous method of determining average stress and strain fields in a composite a modified constitutive model is presented based on experimental results demonstrating the inability of most simple phenomenological models to capture the effective behavior of smas during thermal activation a feedforward controller is presented for a sma composite based on the homogenization of a modified phenomenological model for smas in a linear matrix resonant controllers for smart structures in this paper we propose a special type of colocated feedback controller for smart structures the controller is a parallel combination of highq resonant circuits each of the resonant circuits is tuned to a pole or the resonant frequency of the smart structure it is proven that the parallel combination of resonant controllers is stable with an infinite gain margin only one set of actuatorsensor can damp multiple resonant modes with the resonant controllers experimental results are presented to show the robustness of the proposed controller in damping multimode resonances use of neural networks in the analysis of particle size distribution by laser diffraction tests with different particle systems the application of forward light scattering methods for estimating the particle size distribution psd is usually limited by the occurrence of multiple scattering which affects the angular distribution of light in highly concentrated suspensions thus resulting in false calculations by the conventionally adopted algorithms in this paper a previously proposed neural networkbased method is tested with different particle systems in order to evaluate its applicability in the first step of the study experiments were carried out with solidliquid suspensions having different characteristics of particle shape and size distribution under varying solid concentrations the experimental results consisting of the angular distribution of light intensity particle shape and suspension concentration were used as input data in the fitting of neural network models nn that replaced the optical model to provide the psd the reference values of particle shape and psd for the nn fitting were based on image analysis comparisons between the psd values computed by the nn model and the reference values indicate that the method can be used in monitoring the psd of particles with different shapes in highly concentrated suspensions thus extending the range of application of forward laser diffraction to a number of systems with industrial interest fast accurate meg source localization using a multilayer perceptron trained with real brain noise iterative gradient methods such as levenbergmarquardt lm are in widespread use for source localization from electroencephalographic eeg and magnetoencephalographic meg signals unfortunately lm depends sensitively on the initial guess necessitating repeated runs this combined with lms high perstep cost makes its computational burden quite high to reduce this burden we trained a multilayer perceptron mlp as a realtime localizer we used an analytical model of quasistatic electromagnetic propagation through a spherical head to map randomly chosen dipoles to sensor activities according to the sensor geometry of a 4d neuroimaging neuromag122 meg system and trained a mlp to invert this mapping in the absence of noise or in the presence of various sorts of noise such as white gaussian noise correlated noise or real brain noise a mlp structure was chosen to trade off computation and accuracy this mlp was trained four times with each type of noise we measured the effects of initial guesses on lm performance which motivated a hybrid mlpstartlm method in which the trained mlp initializes lm we also compared the localization performance of lm mlps and hybrid mlpstartlms for realistic brain signals trained mlps are much faster than other methods while the hybrid mlpstartlms are faster and more accurate than fixed4startlm in particular the hybrid mlpstartlm initialized by a mlp trained with the real brain noise dataset is 60 times faster and is comparable in accuracy to random20startlm and this hybrid system localization error 028 cm computation time 36 ms shows almost as good performance as optimal1startlm localization error 023 cm computation time 22 ms which initializes lm with the correct dipole location mlps trained with noise perform better than the mlp trained without noise and the mlp trained with real brain noise is almost as good an initial guesser for lm as the correct dipole location image reconstruction from fanbeam projections on less than a short scan this work is concerned with 2d image reconstruction from fanbeam projections it is shown that exact and stable reconstruction of a given regionofinterest in the object does not require all lines passing through the object to be measured complete nontruncated fanbeam projections provide sufficient information for reconstruction when every line passing through the regionofinterest intersects the vertex path in a nontangential way the practical implications of this condition are discussed and a new filteredbackprojection algorithm is derived for reconstruction experiments with computersimulated data are performed to support the mathematical results gearing up for cls bank continuouslinked settlement a dream of the foreignexchange community for years may finally become a reality by the end of 2002 tools for the analysis of dose optimization i effectvolume histogram with the advent of dose optimization algorithms predominantly for intensitymodulated radiotherapy imrt computer software has progressed beyond the point of being merely a tool at the hands of an expert and has become an active independent mediator of the dosimetric conflicts between treatment goals and risks to understand and control the internal decision finding as well as to provide means to influence it a tool for the analysis of the dose distribution is presented which reveals the decisionmaking process performed by the algorithm the internal tradeoffs between partial volumes receiving high or low doses are driven by functions which attribute a weight to each volume element the statistics of the distribution of these weights is cast into an effectvolume histogram evh in analogy to dosevolume histograms the analysis of the evh reveals which traits of the optimum dose distribution result from the defined objectives and which are a random consequence of under or misspecification of treatment goals the evh can further assist in the process of finding suitable objectives and balancing conflicting objectives if biologically inspired objectives are used the evh shows the distribution of local dose effect relative to the prescribed level option pricing formulas based on a nongaussian stock price model options are financial instruments that depend on the underlying stock we explain their nongaussian fluctuations using the nonextensive thermodynamics parameter q a generalized form of the blackscholes bs partial differential equation 1973 and some closedform solutions are obtained the standard bs equation q  1 which is used by economists to calculate option prices requires multiple values of the stock volatility known as the volatility smile using q  15 which well models the empirical distribution of returns we get a good description of option prices using a single volatility microoptical realization of arrays of selectively addressable dipole traps a scalable configuration for quantum computation with atomic qubits we experimentally demonstrate novel structures for the realization of registers of atomic qubits we trap neutral atoms in one and twodimensional arrays of fardetuned dipole traps obtained by focusing a reddetuned laser beam with a microfabricated array of microlenses we are able to selectively address individual trap sites due to their large lateral separation of 125 mu m we initialize and read out different internal states for the individual sites we also create two interleaved sets of trap arrays with adjustable separation as required for many proposed implementations of quantum gate operations implementation of universal quantum gates based on nonadiabatic geometric phases we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to achieve quantum computation based on nonadiabatic geometric phase shifts in which a cyclic geometric phase is used to realize a set of universal quantum gates physical implementation of this set of gates is designed for josephson junctions and for nmr systems interestingly we find that the nonadiabatic phase shift may be independent of the operation time under appropriate controllable conditions a remarkable feature of the present nonadiabatic geometric gates is that there is no intrinsic limitation on the operation time conditions for the local manipulation of gaussian states we present a general necessary and sufficient criterion for the possibility of a state transformation from one mixed gaussian state to another of a bipartite continuousvariable system with two modes the class of operations that will be considered is the set of local gaussian completely positive tracepreserving maps testing statistical bounds on entanglement using quantum chaos previous results indicate that while chaos can lead to substantial entropy production thereby maximizing dynamical entanglement this still falls short of maximality random matrix theory modeling of composite quantum systems investigated recently entails a universal distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices we demonstrate that these distributions are realized in quantized chaotic systems by using a model of two coupled and kicked tops we derive an explicit statistical universal bound on entanglement which is also valid for the case of unequal dimensionality of the hilbert spaces involved and show that this describes well the bounds observed using composite quantized chaotic systems such as coupled tops entanglement measures with asymptotic weakmonotonicity as lower upper bound for the entanglement of cost distillation we propose entanglement measures with asymptotic weakmonotonicity we show that a normalized form of entanglement measures with the asymptotic weakmonotonicity are lower upper bound for the entanglement of cost distillation the fully entangled fraction as an inclusive measure of entanglement applications characterizing entanglement in all but the simplest case of a two qubit pure state is a hard problem even understanding the relevant experimental quantities that are related to entanglement is difficult it may not be necessary however to quantify the entanglement of a state in order to quantify the quantum information processing significance of a state it is known that the fully entangled fraction has a direct relationship to the fidelity of teleportation maximized under the actions of local unitary operations in the case of two qubits we point out that the fully entangled fraction can also be related to the fidelities maximized under the actions of local unitary operations of other important quantum information tasks such as dense coding entanglement swapping and quantum cryptography in such a way as to provide an inclusive measure of these entanglement applications for two qubit systems the fully entangled fraction has a simple known closedform expression and we establish lower and upper bounds of this quantity with the concurrence this approach is readily extendable to more complicated systems pairwise thermal entanglement in the nqubit n or 5 heisenberg xx chain we have calculated the concurrence of the pairwise thermal entanglement for the fourqubit and fivequbit heisenberg xx chain it is found that there is a great difference between the evenqubit and the oddqubit chain in the aspect of the critical temperature and of the existence of the entanglement for the case of the qubit number n no more than 5 reply to comment on teleportation of an unknown state by w state phys lett a 300 2002 324 in our letter see ibid vol 296 p 161 2002 the main question we consider is whether a general threeparticle w state can be used to realize the teleportation of an unknown qubit state we give the positive answer to this question in our letter and show that w state can be used to realize to do that probabilistically we also discuss how to do it in detail in our letter in the previous comment see ibid vol 300 p 324 2002 authors check carefully the mathematics calculation of our letter find and point out a simple mathematics error about normalization coefficient of eq 1 this mathematics error induces the incorrect probability calculation of eq 6 and also an incorrect claim in first part of our letter sia shelves t1 decision till 2004 the securities industry association has decided that a move to t1 is more than the industry can handle right now stp however will remain a focus quantum sensitive dependence wave functions of bounded quantum systems with timeindependent potentials being almost periodic functions cannot have time asymptotics as in classical chaos however bounded quantum systems with timedependent interactions as used in quantum control may have continuous spectrum and the rate of growth of observables is an issue of both theoretical and practical concern rates of growth in quantum mechanics are discussed by constructing quantities with the same physical meaning as those involved in the classical lyapunov exponent a generalized notion of quantum sensitive dependence is introduced and the mathematical structure of the operator matrix elements that correspond to different types of growth is characterized how to drive strategic innovation law firms innovation it has everything to do with organization

year a striking number of lawyers are in a state of flux from newly minted law school graduates looking for their first job to senior litigators migrating to new challenges with new firms the one certainty is that lawyers new to any firm need care and feeding in myriad ways all of them need to know and understand three things 1 the firms culture 2 the resources available to help them develop

those who seek ways to more efficiently and intelligently manage information efficient combinational verification using overlapping local bdds and a hash table we propose a novel methodology that combines local bdds binary decision diagrams with a hash table for very efficient verification of combinational circuits the main purpose of this technique is to remove the considerable overhead associated with casebycase verification of internal node pairs in typical internal correspondence based verification methods two heuristics based on the number of structural levels of circuitry looked at and the total number of nodes in the bdd manager are used to control the bdd sizes and introduce new cutsets based on already found equivalent nodes we verify the iscas85 benchmark circuits and demonstrate significant speedup over existing methods we also verify several hard industrial circuits and show our superiority in extracting internal equivalences silicon debug of a powerpc tm microprocessor using model checking when silicon is available newly designed microprocessors are tested in specially equipped hardware laboratories where real applications can be run at hardware speeds however the large volumes of code being run plus the limited access to the internal nodes of the chip make it very difficult to characterize the nature of any failures that occur we describe how temporal logic model checking was used to quickly characterize a design error exhibited during hardware testing of a powerpc microprocessor we outline the conditions under which model checking can efficiently characterize such failures and show how the particular error we detected could have been revealed early in the design cycle by model checking a short and simple correctness specification we discuss the implications of this for verification methodologies over the full design cycle oms battle heating up as chicago equity ousts longview for macgregor chicago equity partners llc has gone into full production with macgregors financial trading platform this marks a concentrated effort to achieve straightthrough processing bisimulation minimization and symbolic model checking state space minimization techniques are crucial for combating state explosion a variety of explicitstate verification tools use bisimulation minimization to check equivalence between systems to minimize components before composition or to reduce a state space prior to model checking experimental results on bisimulation minimization in symbolic model checking contexts however are mixed we explore bisimulation minimization as an optimization in symbolic model checking of invariance properties we consider three bisimulation minimization algorithms from each we produce a bddbased model checker for invariant properties and compare this model checker to a conventional one based on backwards reachability our comparisons both theoretical and experimental suggest that bisimulation minimization is not viable in the context of invariance verification because performing the minimization requires as many if not more computational resources as model checking the unminimized system through backwards reachability modular and visual specification of hybrid systems an introduction to hycharts visual description techniques are particularly important for the design of hybrid systems because specifications of such systems usually have to be discussed between engineers from a number of different disciplines modularity is vital for hybrid systems not only because it allows to handle large systems but also because it permits to think in terms of components which is familiar to engineers based on two different interpretations for hierarchic graphs and on a clear hybrid computation model we develop hycharts hycharts consist of two modular visual formalisms one for the specification of the architecture and one for the specification of the behavior of hybrid systems the operators on hierarchic graphs enable us to give a surprisingly simple denotational semantics for many concepts known from statechartlike formalisms due to a very general composition operator hycharts can easily be composed with description techniques from other engineering disciplines such heterogeneous system specifications seem to be particularly appropriate for hybrid systems because of their interdisciplinary character optimal control using the transport equation the liouville machine transport theory describes the scattering behavior of physical particles such as photons here we show how to connect this theory to optimal control theory and to adaptive behavior of agents embedded in an environment environments and tasks are defined by physical boundary conditions given some task we compute a set of probability densities on continuous state and action and time from these densities we derive an optimal policy such that for all states the most likely action maximizes the probability of reaching a predefined goal state liouvilles conservation theorem tells us that the conditional density at time t state s and action a must equal the density at t  dt s  ds a  da discretization yields a linear system that can be solved directly and whose solution corresponds to an optimal policy discounted reward schemes are incorporated naturally by taking the laplace transform of the equations the liouville machine quickly solves rather complex maze problems a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a oneway avoidance experiment we present a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a oneway avoidance experiment our model employs the reinforcement learning paradigm and a temporaldifference algorithm to implement both classically conditioned and instrumentally conditioned components the role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning systems state and action competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system our model displays in simulation the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response these results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior our model extends the traditional twoprocess learning mechanism of mowrer 1947 by explicitly defining the mechanisms of proprioceptive feedback an internal clock and generalization over the action space modeling group foraging individual suboptimality interference and a kind of matching a series of agentbased models support the hypothesis that behaviors adapted to a group situation may be suboptimal or irrational when expressed by an isolated individual these models focus on two areas of current concern in behavioral ecology and experimental psychology the interference function which relates the intake rate of a focal forager to the density of conspecifics and the matching law which formalizes the observation that many animals match the frequency of their response to different stimuli in proportion to the reward obtained from each stimulus type each model employs genetic algorithms to evolve foraging behaviors for multiple agents in spatially explicit environments structured at the level of situated perception and action a second concern of the article is to extend the understanding of both matching and interference per se by modeling at this level sliding mode control of chaos in the cubic chuas circuit system in this paper a sliding mode controller is applied to control the cubic chuas circuit system the sliding surface of this paper used is one dimension higher than the traditional surface and guarantees its passage through the initial states of the controlled system therefore using the characteristic of this sliding mode we aim to design a controller that can meet the desired specification and use less control energy by comparing with the result in the current existing literature the results show that the proposed controller can steer chuas circuit system to the desired state without the chattering phenomenon and abrupt state change controlling in between the lorenz and the chen systems this letter investigates a new chaotic system and its role as a joint function between two complex chaotic systems the lorenz and the chen systems using a simple variable constant controller with the gradual tuning of the controller the controlled system evolves from the canonical lorenz attractor to the chen attractor through the new transition chaotic attractor this evolving procedure reveals the forming mechanisms of all similar and closely related chaotic systems and demonstrates that a simple control technique can be very useful in generating and analyzing some complex chaotic dynamical phenomena on the relationship between parametric variation and state feedback in chaos control in this letter we study the popular parametric variation chaos control and statefeedback methodologies in chaos control and point out for the first time that they are actually equivalent in the sense that there exist diffeomorphisms that can convert one to the other for most smooth chaotic systems detailed conversions are worked out for typical discrete chaotic maps logistic henon and continuous flows rossler lorenz for illustration this unifies the two seemingly different approaches from the physics and the engineering communities on chaos control this new perspective reveals some new potential applications such as chaos synchronization and normal form analysis from a unified mathematical point of view stabilization of global invariant sets for chaotic systems an energy based control approach this paper presents a new control approach for steering trajectories of threedimensional nonlinear chaotic systems towards stable stationary states or timeperiodic orbits the proposed method mainly consists in a sliding modebased control design that is extended by an explicit consideration of system energy as basis for both controller design and system stabilization the control objective is then to regulate the energy with respect to a shaped nominal representation implicitly related to system trajectories in this paper we establish some theoretical results to introduce the control design approach referred to as energy based sliding mode control then some capabilities of the proposed approach are illustrated through examples related to the chaotic circuit of chua controlled projective synchronization in nonpartiallylinear chaotic systems projective synchronization ps in which the state vectors synchronize up to a scaling factor is usually observable only in partially linear systems we show that ps could by means of control be extended to general classes of chaotic systems with nonpartial linearity performance of ps may also be manipulated by controlling the scaling factor to any desired value in numerical experiments we illustrate the applications to a rossler system and a chuas circuit the feasibility of the control for high dimensional systems is demonstrated in a hyperchaotic system philadelphia stock exchange taps timesten for database technology phlx rolls out equity options autoquote system to traders as the first application to leverage its enhanced data architecture complex dynamics in nearly symmetric threecell cellular neural networks the paper introduces a class of thirdorder nonsymmetric cellular neural networks cnns and shows through computer simulations that they undergo a cascade of period doubling bifurcations which leads to the birth of a largesize complex attractor a major point is that these bifurcations and complex dynamics happen in a small neighborhood of a particular cnn with a symmetric interconnection matrix homogenization in lsup infinity  homogenization of deterministic control problems with lsup infinity  running cost is studied by viscosity solutions techniques it is proved that the value function of an lsup infinity  problem in a medium with a

effective hamiltonian must be selected in a careful way the paper also provides a representation formula for the effective hamiltonian and gives illustrations to calculus of variations averaging and onedimensional problems voip leveraging existing cable architecture as operators prepare to enter the voiceoverip fray they are searching for ways to leverage their existing twoway interactive infrastructure there are several approaches for supporting voip on top of the core ip transport network the one garnering the most interest especially in the united states is based on the packetcable 1x architecture this article discusses the packetcablebased approach timeintegration of multiphase chemistry in sizeresolved cloud models the existence of cloud drops leads to a transfer of chemical species between the gas and aqueous phases species concentrations in both phases are modified by chemical reactions and by this phase transfer the model equations resulting from such multiphase chemical systems are nonlinear highly coupled and extremely stiff in the paper we investigate several numerical approaches for treating such processes the droplets are subdivided into several classes this decomposition of the droplet spectrum into classes is based on their droplet size and the amount of scavenged material inside the drops respectively the very fast dissociations in the aqueous phase chemistry are treated as forward and backward reactions the aqueous phase and gas phase chemistry the mass transfer between the different droplet classes among themselves and with the gas phase are integrated in an implicit and coupled manner by the second order bdf method for this part we apply a modification of the code lsode with special linear system solvers these direct sparse techniques exploit the special block structure of the corresponding jacobian furthermore we investigate an approximate matrix factorization which is related to operator splitting at the linear algebra level the sparse jacobians are generated explicitly and stored in a sparse form the efficiency and accuracy of our timeintegration schemes is discussed for four multiphase chemistry systems of different complexity and for a different number of droplet classes extrapolation in lie groups with approximated bchformula we present an extrapolation algorithm for the integration of differential equations in lie groups which is a suitable generalization of the wellknown gbsalgorithm for odes sufficiently accurate approximations to the bchformula are required to reach a given order we give such approximations with a minimized number of commutators algebraic conditions for highorder convergent deferred correction schemes based on rungekuttanystrom methods for second order boundary value problems in t van hecke m van daele j comp appl math vol 132 p 107125 2001 the investigation of highorder convergence of deferred correction schemes for the numerical solution of second order nonlinear twopoint boundary value problems not containing the first derivative is made the derivation of the algebraic conditions to raise the increase of order by the deferred correction scheme was based on taylor series expansions in this paper we describe a more elegant way by means of pseries to obtain this necessary conditions and generalize this idea to equations of the form y  f t y y completion to involution and semidiscretisations we discuss the relation between the completion to involution of linear overdetermined systems of partial differential equations with constant coefficients and the properties of differential algebraic equations obtained by their semidiscretisation for a certain class of weakly overdetermined systems we show that the differential algebraic equations do not contain hidden constraints if and only if the original partial differential system is involutive we also demonstrate how the formal theory can be used to obtain an existence and uniqueness theorem for smooth solutions of strongly hyperbolic systems and to estimate the drift off the constraints if an underlying equation is numerically solved finally we show for general linear systems how the index of differential algebraic equations obtained by semidiscretisations can be predicted from the result of a completion of the partial differential system behavior of rungekutta discretizations near equilibria of index 2 differential algebraic systems we analyze rungekutta discretizations applied to index 2 differential algebraic equations daes near equilibria we compare the geometric properties of the numerical and the exact solutions it is shown that projected and halfexplicit rungekutta methods reproduce the qualitative features of the continuous system in the vicinity of an equilibrium correctly the proof combines cutoff and scaling techniques for index 2 differential algebraic equations with some invariant manifold results of schropp geometric properties of

implicit euler for highorder highindex daes the implicit euler method is seldom used to solve differentialalgebraic equations daes of differential index r or 3 since the method in general fails to converge in the first r  2 steps after a change of stepsize however if the differential equation is of order d  r  1 or 1 an alternative variablestep version of the euler method can be shown uniformly convergent for d  r  1 this variablestep method is equivalent to the implicit euler except for the first r  2 steps after a change of stepsize generalization to daes with differential equations of order d  r  1 or 1 and to variableorder formulas is discussed design analysis and testing of some parallel twostep wmethods for stiff systems parallel twostep wmethods are linearlyimplicit integration methods where the s stage values can be computed in parallel we construct methods of stage order q  s and order p  s with favourable stability properties generalizations for the concepts of a and lstability are proposed and conditions for stiff accuracy are given numerical comparisons on a shared memory computer show the efficiency of the methods especially in combination with krylovtechniques for large stiff systems automating the compliance and supervision process new technology enables large brokerdealers to supervise and ensure compliance across multiple branches and managers convergence of rungekutta methods for nonlinear parabolic equations we study time discretizations of fully nonlinear parabolic differential equations our analysis uses the fact that the linearization along the exact solution is a uniformly sectorial operator we derive smooth and nonsmoothdata error estimates for the backward euler method and we prove convergence for strongly a vstable rungekutta methods for the latter the order of convergence for smooth solutions is essentially determined by the stage order of the method numerical examples illustrating the convergence estimates are presented basin configuration of a sixdimensional model of an electric power system as part of an ongoing project on the stability of massively complex electrical power systems we discuss the global geometric structure of contacts among the basins of attraction of a sixdimensional dynamical system this system represents a simple model of an electrical power system involving three machines and an infinite bus apart from the possible occurrence of attractors representing pathological states the contacts between the basins have a practical importance from the point of view of the operation of a real electrical power system with the aid of a global map of basins one could hope to design an intervention strategy to boot the power system back into its normal state our method involves taking twodimensional sections of the sixdimensional state space and then determining the basins directly by numerical simulation from a dense grid of initial conditions the relations among all the basins are given for a specific numerical example that is choosing particular values for the parameters in our model abundance of mosaic patterns for cnn with spatially variant templates this work investigates the complexity of onedimensional cellular neural network mosaic patterns with spatially variant templates on finite and infinite lattices various boundary conditions are considered for finite lattices and the exact number of mosaic patterns is computed precisely the entropy of mosaic patterns with periodic templates can also be calculated for infinite lattices furthermore we show the abundance of mosaic patterns with respect to template periods and which differ greatly from cases with spatially invariant templates limitations of delayed state feedback a numerical study stabilization of a class of linear timedelay systems can be achieved by a numerical procedure called the continuous pole placement method michiels et al 2000 this method can be seen as an extension of the classical pole placement algorithm for ordinary differential equations to a class of delay differential equations in michiels et al 2000 it was applied to the stabilization of a linear timeinvariant system with an input delay using static state feedback in this paper we study the limitations of such delayed state feedback laws more precisely we completely characterize the class of stabilizable plants in the 2dcase for that purpose we make use of numerical continuation techniques the use of delayed state feedback in various control applications and the effect of its limitations are briefly discussed bistability of harmonically forced relaxation oscillations relaxation oscillations appear in processes which involve transitions between two states characterized by fast and slow time scales when a relaxation oscillator is coupled to an external periodic force its entrainment by the force results in a response which can include multiple periodicities and bistability the prototype of these behaviors is the harmonically driven van der pol equation which displays regions in the parameter space of the driving force amplitude where stable orbits of periods 2nor1 coexist flanked by regions of periods 2n1 and 2n1 the parameter regions of such bistable orbits are derived analytically for the closely related harmonically driven stokerhaag piecewise discontinuous equation the results are valid over most of the control parameter space of the system also considered are the reasons for the more complicated dynamics featuring regions of high multiple periodicity which appear like noise between ordered periodic regions since this system mimics in detail the less analytically tractable forced van der pol equation the results suggest extensions to situations where forced relaxation oscillations are a component of the operating mechanisms local activity criteria for discretemap cnn discretetime cnn systems are studied in this paper by the application of chuas local activity principle these systems are locally active everywhere except for one isolated parameter value as a result nonhomogeneous spatiotemporal patterns may be induced by any initial setting of the cnn system when the strength of the system diffusion coupling exceeds a critical threshold the critical coupling coefficient can be derived from the loaded cell impedance of the cnn system three wellknown 1d map cnns namely the logistic map cnn the magnetic vortex pinning map cnn and the spiral wave reproducing map cnn are introduced to illustrate the applications of the local activity principle in addition we use the cell impedance to demonstrate the perioddoubling scenario in the logistic and the magnetic vortex pinning maps waveletbased levelofdetail representation of 3d objects in this paper we propose a 3d object lod level of detail modeling system that constructs a mesh from range images and generates the mesh of various lod using the wavelet transform in the initial mesh generation we use the marching cube algorithm we modify the original algorithm to apply it to construct the mesh from multiple range images efficiently to get the base mesh we use the decimation algorithm which simplifies a mesh with preserving the topology finally when reconstructing new mesh which is similar to initial mesh we calculate the wavelet coefficients by using the wavelet transform we solve the critical problem of waveletbased methods  the surface crease problem  by using the mesh simplification as the base mesh generation method proof that the election problem belongs to nfcompleteness problems in asynchronous distributed systems this paper is about the hardness of the election problem in asynchronous distributed systems in which processes can crash but links are reliable the hardness of the problem is defined with respect to the difficulty to solve it despite failures it is shown that problems encountered in the system are classified as three classes of problems f faulttolerant nf not faulttolerant and nfc nfcompleteness among those the class nfc are the hardest problems to solve in this paper we prove that the election problem is the most difficult problem which belongs to the class nfc a new merging algorithm for constructing suffix trees for integer alphabets a new approach for constructing a suffix tree tsub s for a given string s is to construct recursively a suffix tree tsub o for odd positions construct a suffix tree tsub e for even positions from tsub o and then merge tsub o and tsub e into tsub s to construct suffix trees for integer alphabets in linear time had been a major open problem on index data structures farach used this approach and gave the first lineartime algorithm for integer alphabets the hardest part of farachs algorithm is the merging step in this paper we present a new and simpler merging algorithm based on a coupled bfs breadthfirst search our merging algorithm is more intuitive than farachs coupled dfs depthfirst search merging and thus it can be easily extended to other applications a dynamic checkpoint scheduling scheme for fault tolerant distributed computing systems the selection of the optimal checkpointing interval has been a very critical issue in implementing checkpointingrecovery schemes for fault tolerant distributed systems this paper presents a new scheme that allows a process to select the proper checkpointing interval dynamically a process in the system evaluates the cost of checkpointing and possible rollback for each checkpointing interval and selects the proper time interval for the next checkpointing unlike the other schemes the overhead incurred by both the checkpointing and rollback activities are considered for the cost evaluation and the current communication pattern is reflected in the selection of the checkpointing interval moreover the proposed scheme requires no extra message communication for the checkpointing interval selection and can easily be incorporated into the existing checkpointing coordination schemes radianz and savvis look to expand service in wake of telecom scandals finance with confidence in network providers waning

message of size m in omn1 time in an ndimensional hypercube it is based on the replication tree which is derived from reachable sets it has greatly improved performance compared to hokaos 1995 algorithm with the time of omnlogn1 the communication in the broadcast uses an allport wormhole router with message replication capability this paper includes the algorithm together with performance comparisons to previous schemes in a practical implementation estimation of blocking probabilities in cellular networks with dynamic channel assignment blocking probabilities in cellular mobile communication networks using dynamic channel assignment are hard to compute for realistic sized systems this computational difficulty is due to the structure of the state space which imposes strong coupling constraints amongst components of the occupancy vector approximate tractable models have been proposed which have product form stationary state distributions however for real channel assignment schemes the product form is a poor approximation and it is necessary to simulate the actual occupancy process in order to estimate the blocking probabilities meaningful estimates of the blocking probability typically require an enormous amount of cpu time for simulation since blocking events are usually rare advanced simulation approaches use importance sampling is to overcome this problem we study two regimes under which blocking is a rare event lowload and high cell capacity our simulations use the standard clock sc method for low load we propose a change of measure that we call static issc which has bounded relative error for high capacity we use a change of measure that depends on the current state of the network occupancy this is the dynamic issc method we prove that this method yields zero variance estimators for single clique models and we empirically show the advantages of this method over naive simulation for networks of moderate size and traffic loads crossentropy and rare events for maximal cut and partition problems we show how to solve the maximal cut and partition problems using a randomized algorithm based on the crossentropy method for the maximal cut problem the proposed algorithm employs an auxiliary bernoulli distribution which transforms the original deterministic network into an associated stochastic one called the associated stochastic network asn each iteration of the randomized algorithm for the asn involves the following two phases 1 generation of random cuts using a multidimensional berp distribution and calculation of the associated cut lengths objective functions and some related quantities such as rareevent probabilities 2 updating the parameter vector p on the basis of the data collected in the first phase we show that the berp distribution converges in distribution to a degenerated one berpsub d psub d  psub dsub 1 psub dn in the sense that some elements of psub d will be unities and the rest zeros the unity elements of psub d uniquely define a cut which will be taken as the estimate of the maximal cut a similar approach is used for the partition problem supporting numerical results are given as well our numerical studies suggest that for the maximal cut and partition problems the proposed algorithm typically has polynomial complexity in the size of the network a large deviations analysis of the transient of a queue with many markov fluid inputs approximations and fast simulation this article analyzes the transient buffer content distribution of a queue fed by a large number of markov fluid sources we characterize the probability of overflow at time t given the current buffer level and the number of sources in the onstate after scaling buffer and bandwidth resources by the number of sources n we can apply large deviations techniques the transient overflow probability decays exponentially in n in the case of exponential onoff sources we derive an expression for the decay rate of the rare event probability under consideration for general markov fluid sources we present a plausible conjecture we also provide the most likely path from the initial state to overflow at time t knowledge of the decay rate and the most likely path to overflow leads to i approximations of the transient overflow probability and ii efficient simulation methods of the rare event of buffer overflow the simulation methods based on importance sampling give a huge speedup compared to straightforward simulations the approximations are of low computational complexity and are accurate as verified by means of simulation experiments design and implementation of a flexible manufacturing control system using neural network design and implementation of a sequential controller based on the concept of artificial neural networks for a flexible manufacturing system are presented the recurrent neural network rnn type is used for such a purpose contrary to the programmable controller an rnnbased sequential controller is based on a definite mathematical model rather than depending on the experience and trial and error techniques the proposed controller is also more flexible because it is not limited by the restrictions of the finite state automata theory adequate guidelines of how to construct an rnnbased sequential controller are presented these guidelines are applied to different case studies the proposed controller is tested by simulations and realtime experiments these tests prove the successfulness of the proposed controller performances theoretical as well as experimental results are presented and discussed indicating that the proposed design procedure using elmans rnn can be effective in designing a sequential controller for eventbased type manufacturing systems in addition the simulation results assure the effectiveness of the proposed controller to overcome the effect of noisy inputs vehicle travel time models for agv systems under various dispatching rules the design and evaluation of agvbased material handling systems are highly complex because of the randomness and the large number of variables involved vehicle travel time is a fundamental parameter for solving various flexible manufacturing system fms design problems this article presents stochastic vehicle travel time models for agvbased material handling systems with emphasis on the empty travel times of vehicles various vehicle dispatching rules examined here include the nearest vehicle selection rule and longest idle vehicle selection rule a simulation experiment is used to evaluate and demonstrate the presented models flexible airjet tooling for vibratory bowl feeder systems vibratory bowl feeders vbfs are machines that feed various small parts in large volume automatic assembly systems their shortcomings like inflexibility and the propensity to jam stem from the use of mechanical orienting devices air jet based orienting devices can be implemented to overcome these limitations applications of passive and active air jet based orienting devices that replace conventional devices for the vbf are discussed passive devices which reject incorrectly oriented parts are discussed first active air jet based orienting devices are then introduced to further improve the flexibility of vbfs since active devices reorient parts into a desired orientation the part motion under their influence is analyzed a number of tests demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of these new orienting devices production capacity of flexible manufacturing systems with fixed production ratios determining the production capacity of flexible manufacturing systems is a very important issue in the design of such systems we propose an approach for determining the production capacity ie the maximum production rate of a flexible manufacturing system with several part types dedicated pallets and fixed production ratios among the different part types we show that the problem reduces to the determination of a single parameter for which we propose an iterative procedure simulation or approximate analytical techniques can be used as the building block performance evaluation technique in the iterative procedure discreteness and relevance a reply to roman poznanski in reply to poznanski see ibid p435 2002 on discreteness and relevance eliasmith claims that all of the concerns voiced by poznanski in his reply fail to offer a serious challenge to the idea that continuity is irrelevant to a good understanding of cognitive systems eliasmith hopes that it is evident that he does not claim that the process in neural systems is discrete but rather that a complete characterization of the process can be discrete these of course are significantly different claims the importance of continuity a reply to chris eliasmith in his reply to eliasmith see ibid vol11 p41726 2001 poznanski considers how the notion of continuity of dynamic representations serves as a beacon for an integrative neuroscience to emerge he considers how the importance of continuity has come under attack from eliasmith 2001 who claims i continuous nature of neurons is not relevant to the information they process and ii continuity is not important for understanding cognition because the various sources of noise introduce uncertainty into spike arrival times so encoding and decoding spike trains must be discrete at some level
